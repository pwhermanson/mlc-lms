# Iconography

Comprehensive icon system and usage guidelines for the MLC-LMS platform, ensuring consistent visual language, accessibility compliance, and educational effectiveness across all user interfaces and contexts.

## Purpose

This specification establishes a comprehensive icon system that supports the MLC-LMS platform's educational mission while maintaining accessibility, consistency, and user-friendly interfaces. The icon system serves multiple critical functions:

- **Visual Communication**: Clear, intuitive visual cues that support learning and navigation
- **Accessibility Support**: Icons that work with screen readers and assistive technologies
- **Educational Enhancement**: Music-specific icons that support music education and theory learning
- **Consistent Branding**: Unified visual language that reinforces the Terry Treble brand and educational approach
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Icons that work effectively across all supported devices and browsers

The icon system is particularly important for supporting students with special needs, as visual cues can provide essential navigation and learning support for users on the autism spectrum and with other learning differences.

## Scope

### Included
- **Navigation Icons** - Dashboard, menu, settings, and navigation elements
- **Action Icons** - Play, pause, submit, edit, delete, and other interactive elements
- **Status Icons** - Progress, completion, error, success, and state indicators
- **Educational Icons** - Music symbols, learning stages, and educational content markers
- **User Interface Icons** - Buttons, controls, and interface elements
- **Accessibility Icons** - Screen reader indicators, keyboard navigation cues
- **Role-Specific Icons** - Student, teacher, admin, and system admin specific elements
- **Music Theory Icons** - Notes, rests, clefs, and other music notation symbols
- **Gamification Icons** - Badges, achievements, leaderboards, and progress indicators

### Excluded
- **Legacy Flash Icons** - Original Flash-based game interface icons (being replaced)
- **Third-Party Icons** - External system icons (handled separately)
- **Hardware-Specific Icons** - MIDI keyboard hardware interface icons (covered in [Keyboard and MIDI Access](../16-accessibility-and-inclusion/keyboard-and-midi-access.md))
