# Localization & Internationalization

*This document outlines i18n and l10n requirements and implementation for MusicLearningCommunity.com*

## Purpose
This specification enables MusicLearningCommunity.com to serve its global user base effectively by supporting multiple languages, cultural contexts, and regional requirements. With over 60,000 students served across 40+ countries, proper internationalization is essential for maintaining educational effectiveness and user engagement worldwide.

The system must support:
- Multi-language user interfaces and educational content
- Cultural adaptation of music education concepts
- Regional compliance requirements (COPPA, GDPR, etc.)
- Currency and payment method localization
- Time zone and date format handling

## Scope

### Included
- **User Interface Localization**: All dashboard elements, navigation, forms, and system messages
- **Educational Content Translation**: Game instructions, learning sequences, and curriculum materials
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Music notation systems, terminology, and pedagogical approaches
- **Regional Compliance**: Privacy policies, terms of service, and data protection requirements
- **Payment Localization**: Currency display, payment methods, and billing formats
- **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG compliance across all supported languages

### Excluded
- **Audio Content Translation**: Musical examples and sound effects remain universal
- **Core Game Logic**: Mathematical and musical algorithms remain unchanged
- **Database Schema**: Core data structures remain language-agnostic
- **Third-party Integrations**: External service localization handled separately

## Data Model

### Core Localization Entities

```sql
-- Language support table
languages (
  language_code VARCHAR(5) PRIMARY KEY,  -- ISO 639-1/639-2 codes
  language_name VARCHAR(100),
  native_name VARCHAR(100),
  rtl BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  sort_order INTEGER
)

-- Localized content storage
localized_content (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  content_type VARCHAR(50),  -- 'ui_text', 'game_instruction', 'curriculum'
  content_key VARCHAR(200),
  language_code VARCHAR(5),
  content_value TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (language_code) REFERENCES languages(language_code)
)

-- User language preferences
user_language_preferences (
  user_id UUID,
  interface_language VARCHAR(5),
  content_language VARCHAR(5),
  fallback_language VARCHAR(5),
  FOREIGN KEY (interface_language) REFERENCES languages(language_code)
)

-- Regional settings
regional_settings (
  region_code VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,  -- ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
  region_name VARCHAR(100),
  currency_code VARCHAR(3),
  date_format VARCHAR(20),
  time_format VARCHAR(10),
  number_format VARCHAR(20)
)
```

### Content Localization Strategy

**Tier 1 Languages** (Full localization):
- English (en) - Primary
- Spanish (es) - Major market
- French (fr) - International reach
- German (de) - European market
- Portuguese (pt) - Brazilian market

**Tier 2 Languages** (UI + Key content):
- Chinese Simplified (zh-CN)
- Japanese (ja)
- Korean (ko)
- Italian (it)
- Dutch (nl)

**Tier 3 Languages** (UI only):
- Additional languages based on user demand

## Behavior and Rules

### Language Detection and Selection
1. **Automatic Detection**: Browser language preference detection
2. **User Override**: Explicit language selection in user settings
3. **Fallback Chain**: English → User's primary language → Browser language
4. **Content vs Interface**: Separate language settings for UI and educational content

### Content Management Rules
1. **Translation Workflow**: Content must be reviewed by native speakers
2. **Version Control**: All translations tracked with source content versions
3. **Approval Process**: Educational content requires pedagogical review
4. **Update Propagation**: Changes to source content trigger translation updates

### Cultural Adaptation Rules
1. **Music Notation**: Support for different notation systems (fixed vs. moveable do)
2. **Terminology**: Region-appropriate musical terms and concepts
3. **Pedagogical Approach**: Adapt teaching methods to cultural expectations
4. **Visual Design**: Consider cultural color associations and layout preferences

## UX Requirements

### Interface Layout Considerations
- **RTL Support**: Right-to-left language layout for Arabic, Hebrew
- **Text Expansion**: UI elements must accommodate 30% text expansion
- **Character Sets**: Full Unicode support for all target languages
- **Font Requirements**: Web-safe fonts that support target character sets

### Key UI States
1. **Language Selector**: Prominent, accessible language switching
2. **Loading States**: Localized loading messages and progress indicators
3. **Error Messages**: Contextual, culturally appropriate error messaging
4. **Success Feedback**: Localized confirmation and achievement messages

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper language declaration for assistive technologies
- **Keyboard Navigation**: RTL-aware keyboard navigation patterns
- **Color Contrast**: Maintain WCAG AA compliance across all language variants
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling for RTL interfaces

## Telemetry

### Localization-Specific Events
```javascript
// Language selection tracking
{
  event: 'language_selected',
  properties: {
    language_code: 'es',
    interface_section: 'dashboard',
    user_type: 'student'
  }
}

// Content engagement by language
{
  event: 'content_viewed',
  properties: {
    content_type: 'game_instruction',
    language_code: 'fr',
    content_id: 'game_123',
    completion_rate: 0.85
  }
}

// Cultural adaptation effectiveness
{
  event: 'cultural_element_interacted',
  properties: {
    element_type: 'notation_system',
    region: 'europe',
    user_engagement: 'high'
  }
}
```
