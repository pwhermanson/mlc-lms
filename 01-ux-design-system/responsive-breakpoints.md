# Responsive Breakpoints

Comprehensive responsive design breakpoints and behavior specifications for the MLC-LMS platform, ensuring optimal user experience across all devices and screen sizes while maintaining accessibility and educational effectiveness.

## Purpose

This specification establishes responsive design breakpoints that enable the MLC-LMS platform to deliver consistent, accessible, and effective user experiences across all supported devices and screen sizes. The breakpoint system supports the platform's diverse user base, from young students (ages 6-18) using various devices to teachers and administrators managing classes and content.

The responsive design system ensures that educational content, game interfaces, and administrative tools remain fully functional and accessible regardless of device, supporting the platform's mission of transforming students into Lifetime Musicians through engaging, multimedia music instruction.
