# All Games Library

*This document outlines the comprehensive games library interface for students, enabling discovery, selection, and access to the complete catalog of music learning games.*

## Purpose

The All Games Library serves as the primary discovery and access point for students to explore and play any available music learning game. This interface supports both structured learning through assigned sequences and free exploration, providing students with immediate access to over 1,400+ games covering all aspects of music education from basic elements to advanced concepts.

## Scope

**Included**
- Complete catalog of all available games organized by concept categories
- Two-tier selection system: Game selection followed by Stage selection
- Multiple view modes: thumbnail grid and detailed list views
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Game availability indicators and status information
- Integration with assignment system and progress tracking
- Responsive design for all device types

**Excluded**
- Game runtime mechanics (handled in [Game Player Shell](game-player-shell.md))
- Assignment creation and management (handled in [Assignment Builder](../04-teacher-experience/assignment-builder.md))
- Administrative game management (handled in [Games Registry](../08-games-registry-and-authoring/games-registry-overview.md))
- Student progress and scoring (handled in [Student Dashboard](student-dashboard.md))

## Core Interface Design

### Two-Tier Selection Structure

Based on the original system's pedagogical approach, the library implements a two-tier selection process:

1. **Game Selection Screen**: Students browse and select from the complete game catalog
2. **Stage Selection Screen**: Upon selecting a game, students choose their preferred learning stage
3. **Full-Screen Gameplay**: Games launch in immersive full-screen mode without header/footer distractions

### Five-Stage Pedagogical Model

Each game follows the proven five-stage learning progression:

1. **Learn (Stage 1)**: Tutorial mode with instruction and guided practice
2. **Play (Stage 2)**: Practice mode with immediate feedback and scoring
3. **Quiz (Stage 3)**: Assessment mode with quantitative evaluation and target scores
4. **Challenge (Stage 4)**: Competitive mode with unlimited scoring potential and global leaderboards
5. **Review (Stage 5)**: Retention mode that repeats Quiz content for reinforcement

**Note**: The Review stage is typically used within learning sequences and may not be prominently displayed in the main library interface, as it's essentially Quiz repetition for retention purposes.

### View Modes

**Thumbnail Grid View (Default)**
- Displays games as visual thumbnails with essential information
- Optimized for 24-36 games per page to minimize scrolling
- Small, efficient thumbnails to maximize content visibility
- Quick visual recognition and selection

**List View**
