# Student Dashboard

## Purpose

The student dashboard serves as the central hub for students to access their assignments, track progress, and engage with the learning platform. It provides a personalized view of their learning journey with clear next steps and motivational elements. The dashboard implements the core pedagogical principles of [mastery-based learning](../00-foundations/pedagogy-principles.md) through structured progression, immediate feedback, and adaptive content delivery.

## Pedagogical Foundation

The student dashboard is designed around the proven pedagogical approach that has made MusicLearningCommunity.com successful for over 60,000 students worldwide. It implements:

### Mastery-Based Progression
- Students must demonstrate mastery (typically 80-85% on Quiz stages) before advancing
- Clear visual indicators show completion status and mastery levels
- Failed attempts provide learning opportunities rather than punitive consequences
- Review stages ensure long-term retention through spaced repetition

### Structured Learning Sequence
Each assignment follows the established Learn → Play → Quiz → Challenge → Review progression:
- **Learn Stage**: Interactive tutorial with guided exploration
- **Play Stage**: Practice mode with immediate feedback
- **Quiz Stage**: Formal assessment determining mastery
- **Challenge Stage**: Optional competitive practice
- **Review Stage**: Spaced repetition for retention

### Adaptive Learning Support
- Content adapts to student performance and learning style
- Free play reconciliation allows students to leverage prior learning
- Progress tracking provides insights for both students and teachers
- Flexible gating allows teachers to customize learning paths

## Integration with Assignment System

The student dashboard integrates seamlessly with the [Assignment Play](../03-student-experience/assignment-play.md) system to provide a cohesive learning experience:

### Two-Tier Game Selection
Based on the original system requirements, students follow a structured selection process:
1. **Game Selection**: Students first choose a Game from the Assignment's game list
2. **Stage Selection**: After selecting a Game, students choose the specific Stage (Learn, Play, Quiz, Challenge, Review)
3. **Chrome-less Play**: Games run in full-screen mode with header and footer removed
4. **Return Navigation**: Upon completion, students return to the Stage selection screen

### Free Play Reconciliation
The system reconciles scores from the All Games library with Assignment requirements:
- If a student has already played a game in free play mode with a qualifying score, the Assignment Play interface can mark that stage as complete
- Teachers can configure whether fresh attempts are required regardless of prior free play scores
- This integration ensures students don't repeat work unnecessarily while maintaining assessment integrity

### Score Recording and Display
- All scores are recorded consistently whether played through Assignments or All Games
- Students can see their progress at a glance with clear completion indicators
- Score recording status is clearly communicated to prevent confusion about progress tracking
