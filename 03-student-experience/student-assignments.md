# Student Assignments

## Purpose
The student assignments interface serves as the central hub where students view, access, and manage their assigned learning content. This specification defines how students interact with assignments generated by the [Assignment Generation Engine](../10-assignments-engine/assignment-generation.md), providing a clear, intuitive interface for accessing their personalized learning path while maintaining the pedagogical integrity of the [Lifetime Musician Curriculum](../07-content-architecture/piano-adventures-alignment.md).

The interface addresses critical pain points identified in the original MLC system, including unclear progression indicators, score recording failures, and navigation challenges that hindered student engagement and teacher visibility into learning progress.

## Scope
Included
- Assignment list view with clear progression indicators
- Two-tier game selection (Game â†’ Stage) following original system requirements
- Score display and progress tracking with real-time updates
- Navigation between assignments and dashboard
- Integration with free play reconciliation
- Accessibility and responsive design requirements
- Error handling and offline resilience

Excluded
- Assignment creation and authoring (handled by [Teacher Assignment Builder](../04-teacher-experience/assignment-builder.md))
- Game runtime mechanics (defined in [Assignment Play](../03-student-experience/assignment-play.md))
- Detailed progress analytics (covered in [Teacher Reports](../04-teacher-experience/teacher-reports.md))
- Billing and subscription management

## Data model (if applicable)
### Core entities
- **Assignment**
  - `assignment_id`, `student_id`, `sequence_id`, `sequence_version`, `name`, `status`, `due_at`, `created_at`
  - `progress_percentage`, `completed_steps`, `total_steps`, `mastery_level`
- **Step**
  - `step_id`, `assignment_id`, `order_index`, `element_type`, `element_id`, `stage`, `state`, `score`, `best_score`
  - `gating_status`, `completion_date`, `attempts`, `mastery_achieved`
- **Game Selection State**
  - `selected_game_id`, `available_stages[]`, `current_stage_id`, `stage_states{}`

### Relationships
- Assignment contains ordered Steps
- Steps reference Games and specific Stages
- Student progress is tracked per Step with score history
- Free play scores are reconciled with assignment requirements

## Behavior and rules
### Assignment list display
- **Sorting**: Primary sort by due date, secondary by creation date

### Two-tier game selection
Based on the original system requirements documented in "All Games Redesign":
1. **Tier 1 - Game Selection**: Students select a game from the assignment's game list
2. **Tier 2 - Stage Selection**: After game selection, students choose specific stage (Learn, Play, Quiz, Challenge, Review)
3. **Chrome-less play**: Games run in full-screen mode with header/footer removed
4. **Return navigation**: Upon completion, students return to stage selection screen

### Score display and recording

## Integration with MLC Ecosystem
The student assignments interface serves as a central coordination point for several key MLC systems:

### Pedagogical Integration
- **Mastery-based progression**: Implements the core pedagogical principles through structured, progressive learning
- **Adaptive learning**: Content adapts to student performance and learning style
- **Spaced repetition**: Review stages ensure long-term retention of mastered concepts
- **Individualized pacing**: Students progress at their own pace while maintaining learning objectives

### Technical Integration
- **Real-time synchronization**: Assignment status updates in real-time across all interfaces
- **Cross-device continuity**: Students can seamlessly switch between devices while maintaining progress
- **Offline resilience**: Cached content and queued updates maintain functionality during connectivity issues
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient loading and caching strategies ensure responsive user experience

### Teacher Integration
- **Progress visibility**: Teachers can monitor student progress in real-time
- **Intervention support**: Early warning systems alert teachers to struggling students
- **Customization options**: Teachers can modify assignment requirements based on student needs
- **Analytics integration**: Progress data feeds into comprehensive teacher reporting systems

## Addressing Historical Pain Points
Based on feedback from the original MLC system, the student assignments interface specifically addresses these critical issues:

### Navigation and User Experience
- **Clear progression indicators**: Students can easily see what they need to work on next
- **Easy dashboard return**: Prominent "Return to Dashboard" button provides quick navigation
- **Game ID display**: Game identifiers are visible for easy reference and support
- **Reduced visual clutter**: Clean, focused interface maximizes learning space

### Score Recording and Display
- **Real-time score updates**: Scores appear immediately after game completion
- **Score recording confirmation**: Clear feedback ensures students know their progress is tracked
- **Score history visibility**: Students can see their improvement over time
- **Reliable score persistence**: Robust systems ensure no progress is lost

### Progress Tracking
- **At-a-glance progress**: Visual indicators show completion status without navigation
- **Mastery level display**: Clear indication of learning achievement levels
- **Next assignment preview**: Students can see upcoming content in their sequence
- **Achievement recognition**: Badges and milestones celebrate student progress

## Open questions
- Should there be a global setting to always require fresh attempts even if free play scores meet thresholds?
- How should the interface handle assignments with mixed completion states (some steps complete, others not started)?
- What level of customization should students have over assignment display and organization?
- How should the system handle assignments that become unavailable due to content changes?
- Should there be a "favorites" system for frequently accessed assignments?
- How should the interface handle assignments with multiple due dates or complex scheduling?
- What level of offline functionality should be provided for assignment viewing and basic navigation?
