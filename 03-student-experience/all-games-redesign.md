# All Games Library Redesign

## Overview
Modernized design specifications for the student-facing games library and selection interface, addressing critical usability issues identified in the original MLC system and implementing a streamlined two-tier game selection experience.

## Description
Enhanced user experience design for game discovery and selection, including improved navigation, search functionality, and visual presentation based on legacy requirements and modern UX principles. This redesign addresses the highest priority improvement needed for the MLC platform, as efficient student game playing is essential to the website's value proposition.

## Core Design Principles

### Two-Tier Game Selection Structure
The redesigned All Games interface implements a clear two-tier structure that separates game selection from stage selection:

1. **Screen 1 - Game Selection**: Students choose either default (thumbnail) or list view to select a game
2. **Screen 2 - Stage Selection**: Upon game selection, students choose from available stages (Learn, Play, Quiz, Challenge)
3. **Screen 3 - Full-Screen Gameplay**: Game/stage is presented in a full-screen experience with header and footer removed
4. **Return Navigation**: Upon game completion, "Quit" returns students to Screen 2 (stage selection)

### Game-Centric Display
- **Primary Focus**: Display games, not game/stages, as the main selection unit
- **Stage Organization**: Each game shows its available stages in a secondary selection interface
- **Thumbnail Optimization**: Very small thumbnails to maximize games visible "above the fold" (24-36 games instead of 12)
- **Review Stage Handling**: Review stage need not be presented in the main interface, as it's just Quiz repetition

## View Modes

### Default View (Thumbnail Grid)
- **Density**: 24-36 games visible above the fold through reduced thumbnail size
- **Information Display**: Game thumbnails with essential metadata
- **Navigation**: Click game â†’ proceed to stage selection
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear game identification over stage details

### List View
- **Format**: Single line per game (not game/stage)
- **Essential Information**: Game ID, Game Name, Skill Level, Skill Area
- **Availability Indicator**: Simple visual indicator of game availability
- **Thumbnail Handling**: Tiny thumbnails, eliminate if single-line format cannot be achieved
- **Search Integration**: Optimized for game name search functionality

## Search and Filtering

### Search Capabilities
- **Game Name Search**: Teachers can assign individual games, students can find specific games without scrolling
- **Hierarchical Search**: Support for Level, Category, Visual/Aural, Skill-based filtering
- **Filter Controls**: Streamlined controls now that single game search is available

### Filter Categories
Based on the original system's game taxonomy:
- **Level**: Difficulty progression from basic to advanced
- **Category**: Rhythm, Melody, Staff & Pitch, Intervals, Chords, Scales, etc.
- **Mode**: Visual, Aural, or Mixed learning approaches
- **Skill Area**: Specific musical concepts and competencies
- **Device Requirements**: MIDI, Microphone, Keyboard-specific games

## Game Information Display

### Essential Metadata
Each game display must include:
- **Game ID**: Unique identifier (GAM-XXXX format)
- **Game Name**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Skill Level**: Difficulty rating (1-10 scale)
- **Skill Area**: Primary musical concept category
- **Visual/Aural Indicator**: Learning mode classification
- **Availability Status**: Clear indication of game accessibility

### Additional Context
- **Target Scores**: Display when relevant for student motivation
- **Stage Availability**: Show which stages (Learn, Play, Quiz, Challenge) are available
- **Device Requirements**: MIDI, microphone, or keyboard requirements
- **Challenge Mode**: Indication if competitive scoring is available

## Full-Screen Gameplay Experience

### Immersive Design
- **Header/Footer Removal**: Game takes up whole screen for maximum focus
- **Back Navigation**: Clear back button if student decides not to play
- **Return Flow**: "Quit" button automatically returns to All Games for next game selection
- **No Distractions**: Remove unnecessary UI elements during gameplay

### Stage-Specific Presentation
- **Learn Stage**: Tutorial and instruction presentation
- **Play Stage**: Practice mode with immediate feedback
- **Quiz Stage**: Assessment with scoring and progress tracking
- **Challenge Stage**: Competitive mode with unlimited scoring potential
