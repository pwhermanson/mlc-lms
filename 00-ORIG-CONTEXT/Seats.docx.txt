Our ENSEMBLE plan pricing is based upon a sliding scale, providing an increasing discount for the purchase of increasing number of student seats.  The base price is $15.95 per month plus $0.20 for each student seat.  The plan begins at 20 seats.  So the price is $0.20 x 20 = $4.00 plus $15.95 = $19.95.  For the first 120 seats the cost is $0.20 per seat.  For the next 120 seats the cost is $0.18 per seat.  Here is the complete chart of per seat costs:
120 - $0.20
120 - $0.18
260 - $0.16
500 - $0.12
1500 - $0.10
1700 - $0.08
1800 - $0.06
Thereafter - $0.05
To make it easy to determine the cost for any number of students we have provided both a price table and a “calculator”.
