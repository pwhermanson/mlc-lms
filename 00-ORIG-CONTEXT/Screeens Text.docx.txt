LIFETIME MUSICIAN – OUR FUNDAMENTAL GOAL


The Lifetime Musician is an active participant in music-making, not a spectator. Lifetime Musicians have a music "skill-set" broad enough to be able to learn new music without having to listen to a recording. These musicians can read, write, think and create in the universal language of music, and can continue learning new music on their own for a lifetime of music enjoyment.
The cornerstone of a Lifetime Musician is the guidance of a dedicated, professional music teacher who understands the multi-dimensional nature of music training. This teacher follows a comprehensive music curriculum that trains the eye, the ear and the fingers, and develops higher order thought processes.
Music listening and reading skills are quickly learned and mastered when presented and practiced through multimedia instructional games. Students work independently, at their own pace, and as each skill is mastered, the teacher guides the student to apply the skills in higher levels of music performance.
  



The skills mastered through MusicLearningCommunity.com are the foundation of a Lifetime Musician. The learning games feature animation, musical sound, sound effects, scores, and timers to keep students interested and progressing. When taught correctly, and with patient practice, anyone, regardless of age, can make beautiful music.

L. PARENTS


Parents
A Family Membership is a great investment in your child's music education.  Teachers report that after one year of playing the learning games their students are 3 to 5 months ahead of where they were before MusicLearningCommunity.com.
Learning the language of music
Learning the language of music is a step-by-step process similar to learning math…one skill builds on another. Both math and music take practice and repetition to gain mastery. Learning music through games has proven to be very effective.
They're having fun…You know they're learning
On this website, students have access to literally hundreds of colorful, interactive music games – from beginning through intermediate levels – that speed them on their way to becoming Lifetime Musicians. Our goal is to help students master the music reading and aural skills they need to achieve satisfaction and success in increasing levels of music performance and creativity.

* Higher levels of sight-reading skill
* Higher scores on student performance evaluations and music theory tests
* Speeds the progress of study in all instruments and voice
* Includes access for up to 5 family members
* Students have access to all levels and all games

* * Did you know... ?
Higher SAT Scores
Students who study music score higher on the verbal and math portions of SAT than students with no course work or experience in the arts.
Engineers and IT
The very best engineers and technical designers in the Silicon Valley are, nearly without exception, practicing musicians.
Enhances spatial-temporal reasoning
Two research projects have found that music training--specifically piano instruction--can dramatically enhance children's spatial-temporal reasoning skills, the skills crucial for greater success in subjects like math and science.  A year of music study, even when it is then terminated, has permanently improved the students’ learning skills.






________________


G.  ADULTS


Adult music students can benefit by taking the approach of “thinking like a kid again” as the games are played.  Obviously, the games have been designed with beginners in mind, who are usually children.  But that does not mean that the subject matter is juvenile.  Like most homeschoolers, adult music students find that, being easy to administer, self-paced and having solid pedagogy, this is a valuable learning environment to support their musical education.  Have fun learning music.
