                HOW DOES IT WORK?


[Home Page—Information] 
GAMES – 
        Types - Each on-line game is designed to teach a specific musical concept, aimed at mastery and retention by the student.  They are designed to be simple, non-threatening, and fun.  Each game has several stages; Learn (tutor), Play (practice), Quiz (quantitatively assess mastery), Challenge (some games scores have no limit, allowing competition among all students worldwide), Review (retention of the concept).  
        Concepts - Games assignments are organized by Level and Group.  They cover aural and visual Pitch, Rhythm, Melody, Chords, Scales, Memory Playing, Intervals, Melody, Staff, Symbols, Keyboard Elements, Pattern Playing, Musical Terms.  Individual games may be found through a hierarchical search.
        Scores - When a game is played all the way to the end a score is achieved and placed in individual student scores history.  Achieving the target score on a Quiz generally indicates mastery of the concept.  Teachers and students may review the student scores history.  
        Sequence - Of great benefit to students and teachers is the inclusion of named game sequences.  These are explained in more detail (see Learning Sequences) below.  The primary sequences are Lifetime Learning (default), Solfege, and Evaluation.  Once a sequence is assigned to a student, upon entering the Student Dashboard the student can select his or her Assignment.  He or she will be presented with the next game set in the sequence that has not yet been completed.  Mixed into the sequence are additional learning elements, which can include text, video, audio, and awards. The Evaluation sequence is generally used to evaluate the proficiency of new students and determine areas of weakness game-playing could improve.

LIFETIME MUSICIAN – OUR FUNDAMENTAL GOAL


The Lifetime Musician is an active participant in music-making, not a spectator. Lifetime Musicians have a music "skill-set" broad enough to be able to learn new music without having to listen to a recording. These musicians can read, write, think and create in the universal language of music, and can continue learning new music on their own for a lifetime of music enjoyment.
The cornerstone of a Lifetime Musician is the guidance of a dedicated, professional music teacher who understands the multi-dimensional nature of music training. This teacher follows a comprehensive music curriculum that trains the eye, the ear and the fingers, and develops higher order thought processes.
Music listening and reading skills are quickly learned and mastered when presented and practiced through multimedia instructional games. Students work independently, at their own pace, and as each skill is mastered, the teacher guides the student to apply the skills in higher levels of music performance.
  



The skills mastered through MusicLearningCommunity.com are the foundation of a Lifetime Musician. The learning games feature animation, musical sound, sound effects, scores, and timers to keep students interested and progressing. When taught correctly, and with patient practice, anyone, regardless of age, can make beautiful music!

PARENTS
With Music Teachers
        MusicLearningCommunity.com was originally designed to be used by private music teachers to assist them in teaching music literacy, utilizing the best elements of technology.  If your child’s music teacher is assigning these learning games to be done at home, your role is to encourage your child in playing them.  It is proven that their music education will be enhanced, and the music teacher’s time can be devoted more to the technical aspects.  You get more value for what you spend.  These learning games are sequenced into a solid pedagogy designed to improve the student’s musical skills step-by-step until mastery of the concepts is gained.  And quantitative scores measure their progress.


Homeschool
        Although employment of a private music teacher is much encouraged, MusicLearningCommunity.com has been found to be very helpful in the homeschool environment, with or without a private music teacher.  The Lifetime Musician sequence (default) is self-paced, and the learning games are automatically presented to the student.  Achieving target scores on the Quiz stage of the games demonstrates the student’s mastery of the concept being taught.  Periodically reviewing the student scores allows you to monitor your child’s progress.


Special Needs
        We have incontrovertible evidence that playing the music learning games is of benefit to children with special needs.  In many cases the result of playing the games is improvement in areas other than music.  The games are intentionally designed to be simple, enjoyable, and non-threatening.  Each game teaches a very simple concept, and the sequencing takes the student from basics to more advanced concepts in a step-by-step process.  The special needs student may benefit from achieving success with concept mastery, or only from playing a game to completion.

        Overview - MusicLearningCommunity.com was originally designed to be used by private music teachers to assist them in teaching music literacy, utilizing the best elements of technology. The games are intentionally designed to be simple, enjoyable, and non-threatening.  Each game teaches a very simple concept, and the sequencing takes the student from basics to more advanced concepts in a step-by-step process. 
        Indispensable Tool - Whether you teach in a private studio or a school classroom – instrumental or voice – this innovative website will become an indispensable learning tool. MusicLearningCommunity.com is a remarkable learning resource of hundreds of colorful, animated music games that teach essential theory and aural skills – a breakthrough Internet website carefully designed for professional music teachers and their students.
        Solid Pedagogy -MusicLearningCommunity.com enhances your current teaching curriculum and correlates with all popular piano teaching methods and state/national standards. As students learn through games, they're reinforcing the music skills you've taught them.


"…once people play these games, they're HOOKED! And knowing that teachers can cross-reference the games with their method of choice makes them tremendously appealing."
- Michelle Gordon, NCTM, independent piano teacher
The pedagogy behind MusicLearningCommunity.com is solid and focuses on developing the complex thought processes required to read music efficiently and become a Lifetime Musician.
"We are so enjoying the site! It's working great with the Smart Board and classroom participation. The kids love it. We had a family night and featured this site. The Rhythm Factory game was a hit with the dads!!"
- Judi Reynolds, Southern Elementary, Fayette, KY
        It Pays for Itself - Many of our teacher-members charge their students $1.00 (or more) per month which is usually more than enough to cover MusicLearningCommunity.com's monthly subscription. Even after six months, the cost to the student is still less than the price of one theory book. If you're not using a computer in your studio, your students can still play the games at home or from any computer that connects to the Internet.  Our teacher-members who use a computer in their studios get double benefit because students can do the Learn and Play levels of the games at home and then do the Quiz levels of the games in the studio computer lab.
"A tremendous hit! You have captured such a refreshing and wholesome tone to these games and learning activities. They are a delight to the eye, the sounds are splendid, the pedagogy is excellent, three cheers – and then some!!"
- Mary Gae George, NCTM, author of Artistry at the Piano
        Parents can see measurable progress! - When students play the extraordinary games on this website, they fall naturally into the learning process. And they're often so absorbed in "playing" that they don't even realize they're learning – discovering solid music concepts that are transforming them into Lifetime Musicians.  Parents are thrilled to have their children spending time online working on their music skills instead of mindlessly surfing the Web. They can see their child's joy in playing the games, and they'll observe solid progress as their child moves through the carefully planned curriculum.
        Keyboard Skills – Every game that involves an interactive keyboard on screen can also be played using a MIDI keyboard attached via USB or Bluetooth, thus supporting the kinesthetic skills of a Master Musician.  (See Internet Access for details)

SCHOOLS
General Music
        MusicLearningCommunity.com was originally designed to be used by private music teachers to assist them in teaching music literacy, utilizing the best elements of technology.  But within a short time of its deployment, MusicLearningCommunity.com subscriptions were being requested by schools.  Initially, the use was by General Music classes for early learners.  The online learning games were found to be very effective. Then other multi-teacher environments were becoming members.  The Christine Hermanson Grant Program provides ENSEMBLE subscribers with sponsorships for school General Music classes subscriptions.  Your school could become a beneficiary.


Band and Choir
        In addition to elementary General Music, at middle school levels it is used by choirs (using the Solfege sequence), and by bands, and orchestras.  In these cases scores history by individual student is helpful in measuring progress.


Combinations
        Either enough seats can be purchased to keep track of each student’s scores history, or generic usernames can be used.  Or combinations are possible.  For example, a school district could provide General Music classes with MusicLearningCommunity.com learning games at every elementary school with one subscription.  For this example, if there were 12 elementary schools, an ENSEMBLE subscription of 24 seats would provide each elementary school with two generic usernames, administered by twelve teachers in total for a cost of $244 per year. Or, this could support 24 elementary and middle schools with single generic usernames.  Or, additional seats could be purchased to support, with scores history, a choir or band, and these seats could retain scores history.


College and Adults
        Even though the games are simple and cartoonish, adult students who “think like a kid again” have benefitted from a MusicLearningCommunity.com subscription.  So, anyone of any age who wants a better grasp of music literacy can benefit from the learning games.  Colleges have used subscriptions to support their music pedagogy classes and for their childcare facilities.  College students have used the games to support their music education.

INTERNET ACCESS with BROWSER and MIDI Keyboard
Internet Connection
A reliable internet connection is required to play the games.  Any computer or mobile device which can properly connect, and stay connected, may be used.  Note that cell phone screens, however, tend to be a little small, making some games difficult to play.  We recommend using tablets instead.


Operating Systems 
MusicLearningCommunity.com and music learning games will run on all of the main computer operating systems: PC, macOS, and Chrome OS (Chromebook); and mobile operating systems, Android, and iOS.  


Browsers
Recent internet browser (after April, 2020) versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and Safari are supported.  Browsers/operating system combinations change over time, however, so sometimes a switch to a different browser might be required.  A chart is provided to make it easier to see what combination of device operating system and browser can be used.  Android and iOS mobile operating systems are supported, but an accommodation for iOS requires installation of our native iOS app for MIDI.

MIDI Keyboards
All of the learning games may be played on the access device, without a separate keyboard.  However, if a game includes an on-screen piano keyboard, the on-screen keyboard may be accessed using an optional external MIDI piano keyboard.  These are connected via USB to a computer, or connected to the computer or mobile device via Bluetooth.  
Upon opening a game there is an indicator when a MIDI piano keyboard is recognized.  Note that even with a keyboard connected the device controls (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen) can still be used.  The MIDI piano keyboard should be connected before the game is accessed.  If problems occur, the browser should be refreshed to re-set the MIDI.
Support for MIDI on PC, Macintosh, Chrome OS and mobile Android devices is provided with the Chrome browser.
Support for  MIDI on mobile iOS is provided by a MusicLearningCommunity.com custom app.  This may be downloaded for free from the App Store. [search for “MusicLearningCommunity.”]  If you have the app, both the music learning system and MIDI will function.


Custom app
        This is only needed for the Apple iOS environment on mobile devices.

LEARNING SEQUENCES
Stages        
A game is presented as a set of ordered Stages: Learn, Play, Quiz, Challenge (certain games), and Review. Each has a target score, and, when playing to completion, a score is achieved that is recorded in the student’s score history.  Reaching the target score on the Quiz usually demonstrates mastery.  The Review is usually presented as part of another assignment and is designed to help with retention of the concept being mastered.  Challenge games allow achievement of higher and higher scores, and high scores are recorded in a Leader Board that can be seen by any member student around the world.


Individual Play
The games may be played in any order, individually, by selecting through search criteria of level and major type (either aural or visual): Rhythm, Meter, Staff, Melody, Scales, Key Signatures, Intervals, Keyboard, Chords, Harmony, Musical Terms.  And then search by sub-categories, to find a specific game/stage to play.  Even when assigned to a sequence, a student may play individual games.  Any scores are retained, and will show up when that game is encountered later in the assigned sequence.


Sequence Play
The real benefit of MusicLearningCommunity.com on-line games is gained by playing the games through one of the automated sequences, where successively games are presented to the student in a specific order by Level and Assignment.  The order is designed to deliver a mix of concept types beginning with the more basic and continually advancing to the more complex concepts to master.  Review games show up at intervals to help learning retention.  
[In addition to the order of game presentation are the insertion of other learning elements such as text, instructional video, music, and achievement rewards.  At the time of release in January, 2021 non-game learning elements are not in place.  Addition of learning elements is a continuing improvement process at this time.]


Sequence Assignment
All students, when created in the system, automatically default to the Lifetime Musician Sequence, but may be assigned to another.  When a student logs in and sees the Dashboard, clicking on the Student Assignment element will lead to the game playing environment and the student will be presented, automatically, with the next game to be played, or other learning element, in his or her assigned sequence.


Available Sequences
Lifetime Musician – this is the default sequence, designed by our founder, Christine Hermanson, to be a logical presentation of concepts by level, and generally follows the most widely used pedagogical models.
Solfege – this is the Lifetime Musician sequence, but whenever the game concept involves note reading, the lettered notes are replaced with solfege (fixed do) do, re, mi fa, sol, la, ti.  This sequence is helpful for voice students.  [NOTE: Not all games using lettered notes have been converted to solfege at the time of release in January 2021, but will be converted as soon as practical.]
Evaluation – this is a sequence made up of selected Quiz’s at each level to represent most of the various types of concepts.  It is designed to be assigned to a student to help evaluate his or her progress, especially assessment of a student new to the teacher.  The student should be assigned to start at a level that seems appropriate to the teacher.  If the student fails to achieve the target score on several games, he or she should be assigned one of the other sequences, to start at a Level one below where he or she was failing to achieve the target scores.
Archived – in Version 1.0 (in this Help Center) members will find archived, detailed information that can be used to manually assign to students sequences that match many popular methods (e.g. Alfred, Faber, Celebrate Piano).  These were used with the original version of MusicLearningCommunity.com prior to 2021.  These are presented as spreadsheets that can be printed, where for specific pages in the related method/theory book, the game that presents the related concept is listed.  These are called “Student Pages”.  For a student to follow the sequence, he or she will need to search for the individual game set (Learn, Play, Quiz), play the set, then search for the next game set.  The benefit in using the Student Pages is that the concepts being taught in the selected games are targeted directly to the method/theory book.  The disadvantage is that MusicLearningCommunity.com cannot provide these in an automated sequence, and thus the student must look up each individual game, as well as missing the various other learning elements embedded in our automated sequences. [NOTE: we are aware that some of the Student Pages are outdated, but these are not planned to be revised.]


[NOTE: Additional automated Sequences are planned.]


Sequence Review  
Teachers have the ability to review each defined music learning sequence in the form of a report, by selecting the Sequence box from their dashboard.  


[Home Page—Information], expandable headings 
CHRISTINE HERMANSON GRANT PROGRAM
        Our founder and course author, Christine Hermanson, dedicated her occupational life to music education, particularly early learners.  And she is a nationally-recognized pioneer in music education technology.  Her teaching philosophy included a conviction that anyone could learn, make, and enjoy music—that music is an integral part of every individual’s experience.  And, as an aid to learning music, she discovered that computer technology could be very effective, particularly in learning music literacy.
        In her honor, the Christine Hermanson Grant Program was established to encourage early learners in music education by providing to schools free subscriptions to MusicLearningCommunity.com for General Music classes.  This is accomplished through a simple sponsor program.  Anyone who subscribes to the ENSEMBLE level (including a school) automatically becomes a sponsor for the school of their choice to provide a free SOLO subscription (of 5 seats) to be used for General Music.  As long as the ENSEMBLE subscription is active, the free sponsored subscription remains active.
        The most effective way to use the learning games with General Music classes of young learners, is where the games are played in a class environment utilizing a Smartboard.  Other configurations can also be useful.
        When a new member obtains an ENSEMBLE subscription, they are provided a unique “sponsor code”.  The member then has a choice of “banking” the sponsorship with MusicLearningCommunity.com or providing the code to a school of their choice.  The sponsored school may then apply for a subscription using that code.  Any “banked” codes will ultimately be used by MusicLearningCommunity.com to provide free subscriptions at their discretion, but will credit the name of the sponsoring member for the donation.
        One example situation might be where a school obtains an ENSEMBLE subscription for their Middle School Choir and then sponsors a free subscription for their Elementary School General Music classes.  








USER HIERARCHY  [Dashboard Page—Resources], expandable headings
        The different kinds of users and their capabilities are listed below.  Note that there is flexibility in defining the Teacher/Administrator roles.  For a SOLO subscription the Subscriber-Administrator and Teacher are the same by default.  For the ENSEMBLE subscription the Subscriber-Administrator can be separated into two roles by assigning a unique username and password to the Teacher-Admin, which otherwise defaults to the same username and password.  Multiple Teachers can then be created by the Teacher-Admin.  This is helpful in school situations where one individual handles the financial aspects (e. g., business office) and another handles the educational activity.

° Created by a Teacher or Teacher-Admin.
° Uses any of several usernames and passwords created by a Teacher or Teacher-Admin.

With which computers, tablets and phones does MusicLearningCommunity.com work?
You can access the website, play the games and work with all of the teacher tools on any computer (PC and Mac) with any internet browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari). The website also works with any Android tablet or SmartPhone that has the Flash Player—including the Kindle Fire! IPad owners can access the entire website—even though the iPad doesn't have the Flash Player—by downloading an alternative browser called "iSwifter" from the App Store.
Can I see my student's scores and progress?
Yes! When students play a game to the end at the studio or at home, their scores are automatically submitted into the teacher's confidential score report. This can be accessed from the Teacher Resource Center—log in with your teacher user name and password.
What age groups does MusicLearningCommunity support?
The learning games are designed for students in pre-school through piano performance level 6. We also have many adult beginners who aren't afraid to "be a kid again" and are having tremendous success learning with our games.
What do you mean by multimedia and interactive?
The learning games include animation, graphics, music and sound effects to stimulate learning and to accommodate all learning styles.
Which learning methods and curricula do your games support?
Our learning games support all teaching methods and state and national standards. We are always sequencing new methods, state achievement evaluations, and curricula. If you have a curriculum you think we should add, please email us.
Do you have any lesson planning tools?
Yes. We have pre-designed lesson sequences for all music teaching situations. There are lesson plans that match the concepts taught in each of the major piano methods – unit by unit. We are in the process of sequencing the games for the various MTNA state achievement programs and the Carnegie Hall – Royal Conservatory of Music "The Achievement Program," (TAP). The "Lifetime Musician" curriculum is the standard sequence for all instruments and for general music in schools. To view and print these sequences, log in with your teacher username and password and scroll down the list of printable teacher tools.
How much does it cost?
There are several plans available starting at $9.95 per month. Click here for a free trial.
I am an independent music teacher. How can my membership pay for itself?
We encourage teacher members to pass the cost of this service on to their students as if purchasing a theory book or as a nominal technology fee. If you have 10 students, and you charge each student $2 per month, that would cover the cost of a $19.95 plan.
Do I have to download and install software onto my computer?
o, MusicLearningCommunity is 100% online and it is available around the world 24/7. You may need to download the free plug-in Flash Player at www.adobe.com if you have a new Mac computer.

Click, "Member Login," and enter your username and password. This will open the Teacher Resource Center. Click "Manage Student Users." This takes you to your Student Roster. This is where you can create usernames and passwords for each of your students. Tip: Create a student username for yourself so you can see what your students see! Please click here for more instruction.
How do I help students stay engaged?
You can help motivate students by making regular lesson assignments and following up on their scores and progress. Many teachers offer contests and incentives that not only encourage the students to achieve target scores, but also serve to energize the whole studio. Click here for some ideas.
How do we keep the parents in the loop?
It is important to train parents as to the benefits of regularly playing the music learning games. Our members have reported that when students play the games for a school year, their musicianship and performance level advances by an extra three to five months. 
How do I manage student users?
Log in with your teacher username and password. Click "Manage Student Users" on the left side of the screen. On this screen, you may add or remove students from the system.

MusicLearningCommunity.com kickoff in Seattle 
A ground-breaking interactive website that promises to become an indispensable teaching tool in the music field was launched today in Seattle, Washington by St. Louis resident Christine Hermanson, an acknowledged pioneer in music education technology. 
MusicLearningCommunity.com is “a playground of musical games” – a site filled with hundreds of extraordinary multimedia learning activities of varying levels, all carefully planned to gain mastery of the elements of music theory, ear training and rhythmic skills in an exciting, challenging environment. 
During the next few days, the nation’s music teachers will discover the innovative methodology of MusicLearningCommunity.com at the Music Teachers National Association (MTNA) annual convention. The five-day event continues at the Seattle Convention Center through next Wednesday. 
The website is “a tremendous hit,” according to Mary Gae George, author of Artistry at the Piano. “Chris has captured such a refreshing and wholesome tone to these

games and learning activities. They are a delight to the eye, the sounds are splendid, the pedagogy is excellent." 
MusicLearningCommunity.com is the brainchild of Christine Hermanson, a leading expert in music and computer-based learning who was described by The New York Times as “a giant of multimedia music who began her work on education computer programs 18 years ago,..." (April 1998) 
Hermanson has been mentoring music teachers since 1980 in the use of computer technology. She says that the Internet now provides the ideal environment to engage students in interactive learning and promoting the lifelong enjoyment of music. 
“MusicLearningCommunity.com is designed to be a fun and exciting learning environment that enhances a teacher’s current curriculum,” says Hermanson. “As students play the games, they fall naturally into the learning process. And they have such fun that they don’t even realize they’re learning solid music concepts. 
“We’re an international community of professional music instructors dedicated to providing our musicians-in-training with exceptional sequential instruction—and transforming our students into Lifetime Musicians.”
