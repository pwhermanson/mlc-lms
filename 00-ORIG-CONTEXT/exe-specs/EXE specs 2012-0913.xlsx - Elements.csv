24,,STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS,,,,,,,
25,,,Game,A discrete set of programmed procedures that teaches a concept in a game form.,,,,,
26,X,,Update 09-11-12,,These are the primary learning elements.,,,,
27,,,,,,,,,
28,,,,,,,,,
29,,,Game Element,"Games, videos, text, music, tasks, and other items predefined to be included in lesson assignments.",,,,,
30,X,,Update 09-11-12,,"""Game Elements"" is used as a generalized term for a variety of presentations that can be made to a student, including games, videos, text, music, and tasks.",,,,
31,,,,,"Non-game elements are called ""supporting media elements"".",,,,
32,,,,,,,,,
33,,,Game Name,The alpha-numeric identification given to a specific game,,,,,
34,,,,,Names are limited to 40 characters,,,,
35,X,,Update 09-12-12,,Game Concept Description (used for assignment label),,,,
36,,,,,Associated with each Game Name is a brief description of less than 100 characters,,,,
37,,,,,,,,,
38,,,Game Stages,Each game has at least three and sometimes four stages through which the student advances,,,,,
39,,,,,"""Learn stage"" is a tutorial introducing the musical concept",,,,
40,,,,,"""Play stage"" is a set of routines for practicing, or ""drill"" of the concept",,,,
41,,,,,"""Quiz stage"" is a set of routines designed to test mastery of the concept by the student",,,,
42,,,,,"""Challenge stage"" is a set of routines associated with specific games that allows unlimited scoring and permits a student to compete with other students world-wide",,,,
43,X,,Update 09-05-12,,"All stages are available to a student, and are separate games, as marked by the stage parameter",,,,
44,,,,,,,,,
45,,,Game Number,An internally-generated unique identifier for each unique game-stage combination,,,,,
46,,,,,"For example, a game ""Fun Notes"" might have an internal number of 12120.  The stages could be numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.  And the last digit position could be reserved for the stage.  So the number for Fun Notes Play would be 12122, and for the Fun Notes Challenge would be 12124.",,,,
47,,,,,"Use of an internal number could avoid some difficulty of mis-spelled or ambiguous naming, and provides a built-in sequence for game ordering in a list.",,,,
48,,,,,The game number is combined with the Named Sequence number and Named Sequence Group number to create a Sequence Assignment code.,,,,
49,X,,Update 09-05-12,,"MIDI games have the same number as any non-MIDI equivalent, but all MIDI games have an ""M"" suffix",,,,
50,,,,,,,,,
51,,,,,,,,,
52,,,Game Description,Each game has a distinct (html) description page,,,,,
53,,,,,A moderately succinct description of what the game teaches and how it does this,,,,
54,,,,,These game descriptions are in the public area of the website and are searcheable (via Google),,,,
55,,,,,A visitor finding a game description is led to a specific marketing page.,,,,
56,,,,,,,,,
57,,,,,,,,,
58,,,Score,A quantitive measure obtained by a student when completing a game--a quantitative measure of achievement,,,,,
59,,,,,Scores are obtained only when game is played to completion,,,,
60,,,,,Scores are recorded in the data base and observable by the student and teacher,,,,
61,,,,,Several scores are retained: date and score when first played; date and score when last played; date and highest score obtained.,,,,
62,,,,,"Scores are presented in the student Assignment Box along side each game and color-highlighted; in green when the target score has been reached, in yellow when a 90% score has been reached, and in red when the score obtained is less than 90%.",,,,
63,,,,,,,,,
64,,,Target Score,A pre-defined value for each game that if obtained by the student represents mastery of the concept being taught,,,,,
65,,,,,Achievement of a target score is a recorded event.,,,,
66,,,,,When the target score has been reached for all games in an Sequence Assignment Group the next Assignment Group is presented to the student,,,,
67,,,,,,,,,
68,,,Concept Category Family,"A set of Concept Categories related to an area of education, e.g. music education, art education, language education",,,,,
69,,,,,,,,,
70,,,,,,,,,
71,,,Concept Category,"A set of definitions of concepts applicable to an area of eductation, i.e, ""musical rythmn"", ""language tense""",,,,,
72,,,,,Every game has an assignment parameter set for every category,,,,
73,,,,,"The parameter setting may be ""null"" (ignored)",,,,
74,,,,,,,,,
75,,,Concept Parameter,"A distinct subcategorization of an area concept, i.e., ""music rhythm 4/4 time""",,,,,
76,,,,,"Category Parameter - every game will be assigned a ""null"", ""include"", or ""exclude"" parameter for each category, indicating that the particular musical concept is represented in the game, or does not apply (""null"" or ""ignore"").",,,,
77,,,,,"The parameters of a concept category are universal across the categories, but the parameters used with Tier 1 and Tier 2 are uniquely defined, and tied to each category.",,,,
78,,,,,New parameters may be added only by the Content Administrator,,,,
79,,,,,,,,,
80,,,Concept Category Tier,Levels of detail of  concept category parameters,,,,,
81,,,,,"The parameters of concept category are universal across the categories, but the parameters used with Tier 1 and Tier 2 are uniquely defined, and tied to each category.",,,,
82,,,,,"Category Tier 1- Most games will have one or more Tier 1 parameter assignments, indicating musical concept details being covered.",,,,
83,X,,Update 09-05-12,,"Category Tier 2 - These parameters are much more specific than Tier 1 and constitute the principal defining features used in sequencing. These wil be marked using Druple tags, rather than pre-definition",,,,
84,,,,,Most categories will not have Tier 2 parameters,,,,
85,,,,,,,,,
86,,,Game Sequence,The order in which games are presented to students to play,,,,,
87,,,,,This order is determined by a combination of elements including:,,,,
88,,,,,(1) Sequence Name,,,,
89,,,,,(2) Sequence Level,,,,
90,,,,,(3) Sequence Unit,,,,
91,,,,,(4) Sequence Assignment Group code,,,,
92,,,,,"Sequencing is primarily an assignment of a succession of concepts, which in turn results in presentation of games that support those concepts.  Said another way, the result is a selection of games to be played, but the mechanism by which this happens is a selection of a series of concepts.",,,,
93,,,,,Example of sequence of assignment groups:,,,,
94,,,,,"{Named Sequence, Level, Unit, Group}",,,,
95,,,,,"(1) ""Alfred Premier"", ""Primary"", ""Unit 1"", ""A""",,,,
96,,,,,"(2) ""Alfred Premier"", ""Primary"", ""Unit 1"", ""B""",,,,
97,,,,,"(3) ""Alfred Premier"", ""Primary"", ""Unit 1"", ""C""",,,,
98,,,,,"(4) ""Alfred Premier"", ""Primary"", ""Unit 2"", ""D""",,,,
99,,,,,,,,,
100,,,Named Game Sequence,A game sequence organization which is directly related to a pre-established or published teaching method,,,,,
101,,,,,"Music publishing companies have published series of piano teaching books, i.e. ""Faber"", ""Alfred""",,,,
102,,,,,"MLC incorporates its own ""Lifetime Musician Curriculum""",,,,
103,,,,,These may be added only by the Content Administrator,,,,
104,,,,,"Once created, a named game sequence is universally available",,,,
105,,,,,A sequence is unique by Name and Level.,,,,
106,,,,,Expectation is that the order of magnitude of number of named game sequences is under 100.,,,,
107,,,,,,,,,
108,,,Sequence Level,The first sub-division of a Named Sequence,,,,,
109,,,,,"Combined with Name, this creates a unique individual Named Sequence",,,,
110,,,,,,,,,
111,,,Sequence Unit,The second sub-division of a Named Sequence--sub-division of a Sequence Level,,,,,
112,,,,,"This is additional sub-categorization of a level, to correlate with the external source materials.",,,,
113,,,,,"Also available is a descriptive box which can hold other information, such as page number.",,,,
114,X,,Update 09-05-12,,"A student's initial sequence assignment must be defined at the ""Sequence"", ""Level"", ""Unit"" detail",,,,
115,,,,,,,,,
116,,,Lifetime Musician Curriculum,The default named game sequence,,,,,
117,,,,,This is used as the default for game category searches,,,,
118,,,,,This is the default for game assignments,,,,
119,,,,,Used as the curriculum for the PLL website,,,,
120,,,,,Is the basis for creation of a custom named game sequence,,,,
121,,,,,"Every game is coded with a LMC sequence group number, which is the number of the Sequence Assignment Group in which the game first appears in the LMC sequence.  This number is used for automatic addition of new games to the already-established Named Sequences.",,,,
122,,,,,,,,,
123,,,Custom Game Sequence,A custom named game sequence created by a Teacher for use with his or her students by assignment,,,,,
124,,,,,A utility feature presents the details of the Lifetime Musician Curriculum sequence with all of its parameters selected,,,,
125,,,,,"The teacher provides a new name for a custom curriculum, which in the background is associated directly with that teacher's profile, and may be used only by that teacher",,,,
126,,,,,The concept is that in the background this is simply a stored set of data base searches,,,,
127,,,,,"Expectation is that the order of magnitude of number of custom game sequences is under 100 in total, with only one to four per teacher that uses the feature.",,,,
128,,,,,,,,,
129,,,Sequence Definition,The process of matching a named sequence to individual game concepts through selection of parameters,,,,,
130,,,,,,,,,
131,,,,,,,,,
132,,,,,,,,,
133,,,Sequence Selection,The abiity of a teacher or parent to assign a named sequence to a student,,,,,
134,,,,,,,,,
135,,,Sequence Assignments,The ordered set of individual assignments of individual games and groups of games matching a Named Sequence,,,,,
136,,,,,"When a sequence selection is made the entire sequence is assigned to a student, but for practical purposes the student needs to be given only pieces--sets of games--to learn and play for a period of time, before moving on to the next groups of games in the sequence.  These groups are the ""homework assignments"".",,,,
137,,,,,Assignment group codes are used to identify these sequence assignments.,,,,
138,,,,,The individual assignments order is retained.,,,,
139,X,,Update 09-05-12,,"A student's initial sequence assignment must be defined at the ""Sequence"", ""Level"", ""Unit"" detail",,,,
140,,,,,,,,,
141,,,Sequence Assignment Group Code,A code assignment to a named sequence that splits the sequence into groups for assignment,,,,,
142,,,,,"When a student enters their landing page the assignment that appears is the ""current"" assignment group",,,,
143,,,,,The code is a number that is assigned--the same number is assigned to each element that is to be in the same group.,,,,
144,,,,,"The number may be a decimal, permitting insertion of a new group in between two previously established Sequence Assignment Groups without having to renumber all subsequent groups.",,,,
145,,,,,,,,,
146,,,Sequence Chain,An option to pre-set one Named Sequence to automatically follow another Named Sequence,,,,,
147,,,,,This is used to enable a teacher to tie a student to a Named Sequence and not have to repeat with successive sequences.,,,,
148,,,,,"It is specifically used with the Lifetime Musician Curriculum, which is broken into several Named Sequences (by Level).",,,,
149,,,,,"The code is set in the sequence intended to follow another one, by naming the preceding sequence.  The entry of data into this field activates the automated feature.  In the absence of this data when a Named Sequence is completed a student receives no further assignments  until the Teacher assigns another Named Sequence to the student.",,,,
150,,,,,,,,,
151,,,Game Categorization,The administrative process of identifying with parameters the details of concepts taught by an individual game,,,,,
152,,,,,"This process requires assigning parameters at the category, Tier 1 and Tier 2 levels, as many as needed to fully define the musical concepts involved.",,,,
153,,,,,This task is only performed by the Content Administrator,,,,
154,,,Game Category Search,Search for a game or group of games based upon the concepts being taught,,,,,
155,,,,,At minimum this search requires selection criteria to include at least one category,,,,
156,,,,,"Can be performed by teacher, parent, or student",,,,
157,,,,,Marking additional selection criteria at the category level will narrow the search,,,,
158,,,,,"The selection criteria are ""and'ed"", meaning an sql AND statement, where all selection criteria must be true to retrieve a data base selection.",,,,
159,,,,,"The result of a search can be entered into the Custom Current Assignments box of a student profile, becoming part of the next assignment.",,,,
160,,,Assignment Group,Ordered set of learning elements focused on music learning games that teach individual concepts,,,,,
161,X,,Update 09-06-12,,Correlated with external methods by a Sequence Name/Level/Unit & Description,,,,
162,,,,,Defined internally with a group number and a group level number,,,,
163,X,,Update 09-12-12,,Every definition has several components:,,,,
164,X,,,,     Title:  A general name for the assignment group,,,,
165,X,,,,"     Sequence:  The name of the sequence (e.g., ""Alfred Premier"")",,,,
166,X,,,,"     Level:  Generally a specific, such as ""Level 1"", but could be something else",,,,

180,,,,,,,,,
181,,,,,,,,,
182,,,Supporting Media Elements,"Videos, text, music, awards, and other defined teaching elements can be categorized just as games",,,,,
183,,,,,These are used to prepare students for their assignments or to reinforce what has been learned.  They can also be used as a type of reward for completing the assignments.,,,,
184,,,,,"Categorization of a supporting media element is accomplished in exactly the same fashion as a game, i.e. supporting media elements are a sub-category of games.",,,,
185,,,,,,,,,
186,,,Pre-Assignment Pane,"Before the Assignment Pane a box provides learning activities or supporting media  including video, music, and text",,,,,
187,X,,Update 09-11-12,,"This is also called the ""introduction pane""",,,,

1340,,,Process Description,Adding a new game.,,,,,
1341,,,,,Most of this game creation process takes place external to the website and then the finished game is added to the system.  This specification deals with the addtion to the system of a game not currently present.,,,,
1342,,,,,"The game is established, then added to the LMC Sequence, then added to all other sequences.",,,,
1343,,,,,"Supporting media elements such as videos, music, and text are included in the general defintion of game.",,,,
1344,,,,,,,,,
1345,,,Steps to Establish Game,,,,,,
1346,,,1,Naming the game in the data base,,,,,
1347,,,2,Adding the game to the website from the development environment,,,,,
1348,,,3,"Connecting the game to the name, and establishing the game number",,,,,

1351,,,6,Saving the game,,,,,
1352,,,,,,,,,
1353,,,Steps to Sequence to LMC,,,,,,
1354,,,1,"Using the standard functionality, the Lifetime Musician Curriculum Sequence is brought up for edit",,,,,
1355,,,2,"Using the search function, the Inactive new game is selected",,,,,
1356,,,3,The new game is then dragged and dropped to the determined Sequence Assignment group of LMC,,,,,
1357,,,4,"The group number is noted, and then:",,,,,
1358,,,5,The game is edited to add the LMC Group Number to the game.,,,,,
1359,,,,,,,,,
1360,,,Steps to add to all Named Sequences,,"{This is being delayed until Phase V or later}  Updated 09-11-12
Instead of an automatic process, a report will be used to identify where the LMC Group number of the new game appears in each existing sequence.  Using this report as a guide the new game wil be manually added to each sequence.",,,,
1361,,,1,Access the special function for adding to Named Sequences,,,,,
1362,,,2,Select the game to be added to all of the Named Sequences,,,,,
1363,,,3,Execute the process,,,,,
1364,,,,a,The process will recognize the LMC Sequence Group number of the new game,,,,
1365,,,,b,Successively every existing Named Sequence (other than LMC) will be reviewed,,,,
1366,,,,c,For each Named Sequence a search will proceed to find the first Assignment Group that has a game assigned with the LMC Sequence Group number being queried.,,,,
1367,,,,d,"Upon finding the group containing the game with the matching LMC Assignment Group number, the new game will automatically be entered into the same Assignment Group code",,,,
1368,,,,e,"If the LMC Sequence Group number is not found in any Named Sequence, the new game will not be added to that sequence.",,,,

1411,,,,,,,,,
1412,,,3,Name the Level,,,,,
1413,,,,,"This will normally correspond to a grouping name of the external source, e.g. ""Primary""",,,,
1414,,,,,Name and Level together identify a unique named sequence.,,,,
1415,,,,,,,,,
1416,,,4,Name the Unit,,,,,
1417,,,,,"This will normally correspond to some sub-grouping within the grouping of the exernal source, e.g. ""Note Naming"", ""Pages 6-15""",,,,
1418,,,,,There are two parts; the Unit name and a descriptive box.,,,,
1419,,,,,,,,,
1420,,,5,Assign a group code,,,,,
1421,,,,,"This code, a decimal number, identifies the group of concepts aligned with the Level-Unit combination.  A group code can either split or group elements of a named sequence.",,,,
1422,,,,,,,,,
1423,,,6,Assign concept category parameters to the Sequence-Level-Unit-Group Code combination,,,,,
1424,,,,,"As each concept category is chosen, the user is presented with the hierarchy of parameters for that category, and one or more parameters may be selected.",,,,
1425,,,,,As parameters are selected the results appear in a Sequence Group Box (in another area of the screen),,,,
1426,,,,,"A search of the games that match these parameters will bring back the ""sequence assignment"" to be presented to the student.",,,,
1427,,,,,"The sequence assignment search takes place dynamically as the sequencing process takes place. That is, on ""Enter"" the list of games associated with the concept category parameters chosen is presented.  This enables the Content Administrator to verify immediately the results of the parameters chosen.",,,,
1428,,,,,"The parameter selection area may be closed in order to see more clearly the group boxes, sequentially presented in a vertical listing, with associated game assignments to the right.",,,,
1429,,,,,,,,,
1430,,,7,"From the results of the game search, select those games to be named in the open Sequence Assignment Group",,,,,
1431,,,,,This selection should be a drag and drop process.,,,,
1432,,,,,"All games presented in the search box should have an indicator as to whether they already have been defined in the open Named Sequence.  However, the same game may be used in more than one group in the same sequence.",,,,
1433,,,,,"The selected Game may be placed in the Pre-Assignment area, the Assignment area, or the Post-Assigment area",,,,

1479,,,Steps,,,,,,
1480,,,1,When a Named Sequence is created the Sequence Assignment Groups are defined,,,,,
1481,,,,,Each Sequence Assignment Group has a Sequence Assignment Group Number,,,,
1482,,,2,"Target Scores are established for each Game, and defined in the system when a Game is added",,,,,
1483,,,3,"When a student profile is defined, a Named Sequence is assigned.",,,,,
1484,,,,,This determines what series of Assignments are going to be presented to the Student,,,,
1485,,,,,The first Sequence Assignment Group (of game names) appears in the Assignment Pane when the Student accesses the games to play,,,,
1486,,,,,"Before any games have been played the target scores appear alongside each game, with no special markings",,,,
1487,,,,,There are several score columns:,,,,
1488,,,,a,Target Score,,,,

1499,,,,,,,,,
1500,,,5,The Student plays the assigned games to completion,,,,,
1501,,,,,"For each game played to completion the score is recorded and compared to the Target Score, and the scores are color coded in the Assignment Pane (as otherwhere described)",,,,
1502,,,6,When all of the games are played and all of the Target Scores reached the next Assignment Group is presented,,,,,
1503,,,,,At this point all of the game scores in the first Assignment Group were marked green,,,,
1504,,,,,When the last game in the Assignment Group has been successfully completed the Student is notified,,,,
1505,,,7,"At any time in the game-playing process the Student may press a ""SKIP"" button which will present the next Assignments",,,,,
1506,,,,,The SKIP process permits the student to play ahead even though all current assignments are not completed,,,,
1507,,,,,"When the Student next logs in to the games, the first incomplete Assignment Group will again be presented, with the current score status.",,,,
1508,,,,,"Until all games in an assigment have been completed, the SKIP process will have to be used to advance",,,,

1527,,,,,"The ""Game Search by Category"" functionality is accessed and a screen layout is presented to the user",,,,
1528,,,,,"The selection of Categories, Tier 1 parameters and Tier 2 parameters in combination will result in retrieval of a set of games (and supporting media) matching that combination.",,,,
1529,,,,,From the retrieved set the user may select the one desired and play it.,,,,
1530,,,,,,,,,
1531,,,And vs Or,"The logic of the search needs to be made simple so that the user can combine ""and"" and ""or"" selection criteria",,,,,
1532,,,,,"The default situation is ""And"", where the game retrieved must match all of the selected conditions, i.e. if both Major and Minor Chords are selected the retrieved games must include both Major and Minor.",,,,
1533,,,,,"If a user wanted to find games that included Major ""Or"" Minor, then some change in the search parameters must be made.",,,,
1534,,,,,"In many cases simple selection of only the Tier 1 parameters will be sufficient to find a set of games that meet the need for the ""Or"" condition, but Chords is a good counter-example, since Major and Minor are Tier 1 parameters and the resultant set will be comparatively very large",,,,

1659,,,,,,,,,
1660,,,Mass Activation Upload,Utility to permit upload for school use of teacher and student information from flat files (csv).,,,,,
1661,,,,,The expectation is that a school IT department will generate student lists and place them in the required format for upload.

1812,,Schools Narrative,,,Added 09-11/12,,,,
1813,,,,,,,,,
1814,,,Administrative Structure,,,,,,
1815,,,,User Roles,,,,,
1816,,,,,"User Roles.  There are three user levels: Administrator, Teacher/Classroom, and Student.  These correspond to distinct roles within the system, having different access to the learning system and website functions.  ",,,,
1817,,,,School Membership,,,,,
1818,,,,,"School Membership.  Membership by the school in MusicLearningCommunity.com is a requirement.  This subscription is free.  Upon creating the membership the type of membership (School) is selected, and the Administrator is named.  If the Administrator personally is a member, that membership is not used for the school.  Billing is related to member number and grouping.  All payments are made to MusicLearningCommunity.com, LLC.",,,,
1819,,,,Member Grouping,,,,,
1820,,,,,"Grouping.  It is also possible to group schools together within a district for volume pricing, since school subscriptions are based upon the number of students who will be accessing the system.  This grouping may be done at any time.  For example, one school might become a member and then, based upon seeing the successful results from that program other schools in the district might want subscriptions.  At that point multiple schools may be grouped together to get the best pricing for all.  There is no pricing benefit by grouping unless the minimum total of 1350 student slots are reserved.",,,,
1821,,,,District Membership,,,,,
1822,,,,,"District Membership.  Grouping schools together is done via a district membership in MusicLearningCommunity.com.  (This can also be used to group multiple products together, e.g. ComePlayMusic.com and ComeSingMusic.com).  When the membership is created the member type “District” is selected.  An Administrator for the District must be named.  That person may be distinct or could be the same person as one of the Schools.  Billing information for the district needs to be entered",,,,
1823,,,,School Administrator,,,,,
1824,,,,,"School Administrator.  This is the person who will administer the system for the school.  If multiple schools are involved, there must be an administrator named for each school, although the same person could be assigned to each of these roles. Often the School Administrator is the music teacher. The School Administrator adds Teacher/Classrooms to the system and connects students with Teacher/Classrooms.  This role also supervises the automated upload of students.  The School Administrator can set up a Teacher username and password so that he or she can act in the Teacher role as well.  ",,,,
1825,,,,Teacher/Classroom,,,,,
1826,,,,,"Teacher/Classroom.  There is no limit to the number of Teacher/Classrooms that can be set up.  The subscription limits are on the number of student usernames.  The role can be named with an individual teacher name, a class name, or combination.  For example, SmithJMWF might mean John Smith’s class Monday, Wednesday, Friday; or 4JSmith might represent John Smith Fourth Grade.  Generally the system documentation will refer to “Teacher” for this role.  ",,,,
1827,,,,,"The Teacher may define student usernames and passwords, monitor student score reports, and make both automated and custom assignments.  A Teacher only sees the students that he or she has defined, or those that have been automatically uploaded to his or her Teacher/Classroom role.",,,,
1828,,,,,"There are two primary options on how the learning system can be used; (1) Lab with generic usernames, (2) Individual students.  In the first scenario the annual subscription limited to 50 students is most frequently used.  This provides 50 user “slots” for use.  The Teacher defines generic usernames and passwords for these slots, such as CPMX01, CPMX02, UserJJK1, UserJJK2, UserJJK50, for example, and then simple passwords such as “tune”, “music”, etc.  (Note that the username must be unique among the worldwide users of ComePlayMusic).  The learning system is then used in a lab situation, each student signing in with one of the 50 users.  Although scores are obtained upon completing a game, the individual student score-keeping function is really not being used for student progress tracking, as multiple students are using the same logon credentials.",,,,
1829,,,,,"In the second scenario the individual student is set up with his or her own unique username and password.  Their game scores are retained, automatic awards are given for completion of assignments, and they can compete in the world-wide competition with Challenge-level games.  And the students can play their game assignments at home or wherever they have internet access.",,,,
1830,,,,Student,,,,,
1831,,,,,"Student.  The student role can log in to the system using the unique username and password assigned to them.  They can then automatically be presented with their assignment, following a pre-established curriculum, play the games, and see their scores.  They have access to an Recognition Board where they can see the awards earned.  Depending upon the school’s choices, the student can access the system only from the school lab or from most devices having internet access from school or home.",,,,
1832,,,,,,,,,
1833,,,Pricing & Billing,,,,,,
1834,,,,Pricing,,,,,
1835,,,,,"Pricing.  A school subscription is based upon the number of student slots being reserved for student access and is an annual subscription for the school year with no charge for the summer months.  Pricing is per school unless there is a district member, the schools are grouped using that member number, and the minimum total students of 1350 is reached.  In that case all schools have the same lowest price for the total number of student slots reserved. For access to the games that use a MIDI keyboard the cost is $30.00 per school annually, and there are no applicable discounts.",,,,
1836,,,,Adding & Deleting Student Slots,,,,,
1837,,,,,"Adding & Deleting Student Slots.  This function may be performed by the School Administrator.  More student slots may be reserved at any time, but there is no proration based upon the date added.  If the number of student slots is reduced, there is no rebate during the billing cycle.  The automatic renewal will use the number of reserved student slots in effect at the end of the billing cycle as the basis for the renewal bill.  Administrators should be cautioned that adding reserved student slots has an immediate financial impact.",,,,
1838,,,,Billing,,,,,
1839,,,,,"Billing.  At the time the beginning subscription is initiated online, the number of student slots to reserve is requested.  That number is used in the pricing schedule and an invoice is automatically generated and e-mailed to the school contact.  For example, if the need is to reserve space for 470 students the price calculated would be $680 for 400 plus $127.50 for an additional 75 ($42.50 x 25 X 3), for a total of $807.50.  In this case it would probably be better to subscribe for 500 students, since the price for 500 is $825.",,,,
1840,,,,,"Once the invoice has been generated the account is in a “pending” status until receipt of payment.  However, during this period the website is fully accessible by the member administrator, teachers, and students.  Payment in full is expected within 30 days of the invoice.",,,,
1841,,,,Renewal Billing,,,,,
1842,,,,,"Renewal Billing. The School Administrator needs to enter the billing cycle renewal date in the account management profile for the system to use to coordinate billing dates with the school year processes.  It is assumed that the school will wish to continue with its subscription.  The renewal date entered by the Administrator is only month and day—no year is required.  This date is picked up each year and an invoice automatically created and sent 30 days prior to that date, based upon the profile that exists as of the renewal date, that is the number of students, addresses, contacts, purchase order number, etc.",,,,
1843,,,,,Upon receiving a renewal invoice if the school does not wish to continue the subscription the Administrator need only go to the account management profile and select the suspend or cancel option.,,,,
1844,,,,Purchase Orders,,,,,
1845,,,,,"Purchase Orders.  MusicLearningCommunity.com LLC does not require purchase orders, as all functions can be performed fully on-line.  There is a field in the member account management profile for the School Administrator to enter a purchase order number if needed by the school.  This number will be picked up in the automated billing process and will display on the invoice.",,,,
1846,,,,,"If a purchase order is sent to MusicLearningCommunity.com, an e-mail response will be sent to the contact with instructions for accessing the website to set up the member profile and start the subscription process.  Invoices will then be generated in the normal manner.",,,,

1922,,,Lessons,Student Lessons,,,,,
1923,X,,Update 09-11-12,,"“Student Lessons” are presented as sequential organized groups of learning elements, where each group is an “Assignment”.  The sequence in which these Assignments are presented is directly correlated to an external piano method, state curriculum, or other specifically “Named Sequence” of teaching musical concepts.",,,,
1924,,,,Automatic Presentation,,,,,
1925,,,,,"Automatic Presentation.  Once the specific sequence has been given to an individual student (in the student management area), when the student logs in to his or her “Student Lessons” the next Assignment in the sequence is automatically presented.  A student is expected to complete all of the elements of an Assignment before moving to the next one, which will be automatically presented.",,,,
1926,,,,Sequence Naming,,,,,
1927,,,,,Sequence Naming.  To tie the external sequence to the internal assignment group an organizational naming convention is used.  The external sequence is identified with a Sequence Name.  Then it is broken down into Sequence Levels (often corresponding to a single method book).  Finally these levels are broken down in sections called Sequence Units.  The concepts taught in a single Sequence/Level/Unit are then presented to the student as one or more Assignment Groups (“Assignment”).,,,,
1928,,,,Assignment Groups,,,,,
1929,,,,,"Assignment Groups.  An Assignment group consists of an ordered set of learning elements (including video, text, music, “awards”, and games), focused on music learning games that teach the individual concepts.  Each Assignment group, when originally defined by the Content Administrator, includes some additional internal information used to help manage the learning system. Such internal information includes group number and group level.",,,,
1930,,,,Panes,,,,,
1931,,,,,"Panes.  This Assignment set or “group” is presented in three sequential parts; an introduction or preview “pane”, a main assignment “pane” (the games), and a summary “pane”.  The main assignment pane is actually split into three sub-panes, where the first holds the automatic non-MIDI game assignments, the second holds automatic MIDI game assignments, and the third holds any additional games specifically assigned by the teacher.",,,,

1933,,,,,"Pane Appearing.  The introduction pane appears first and the other panes are not available until this first pane is completed.  Then the main pane appears.  When the first two panes are completed the last pane appears.  The summary pane may include awards, challenge games, or other learning elements, including audio files.  A quiz review, which is the presentation of a previously mastered game’s quiz stage to verify that a student has retained his or her mastery of the concept, may appear in the main assignment pane.",,,,
1934,,,,Game Stages,,,,,
1935,,,,,"Game Stages.  When learning games are presented the “learn”, “play”, and “quiz” stages of each game are all included.  A student is permitted to skip to the quiz stage, and if a target score is reached at that stage, the “learn” and “play” stages are considered to have been completed.  The “challenge” stage of the game will appear in the third pane.",,,,
1936,,,,Remediation,,,,,
1937,,,,,"Remediation.  If a student has played only the quiz stage and has not reached the target score after 5 tries, then the student is automatically presented with the learn stage game.  If the student plays the learn, play, and quiz stages and has not reached the target score after 5 tries, a notice is automatically sent to the teacher or family administrator of that fact.",,,,
1938,,,MIDI,MIDI Games,,,,,
1939,X,,Update 09-11-12,,"MIDI games.  Certain games are configured to utilize a MIDI keyboard attached to the computer used to play the games.  These games cannot be played on a mobile device.  Nor can they be played if the student does not have a MIDI keyboard.  In many cases there is a corresponding non-MIDI game.  These games are defined in any sequence for which they are applicable, but should not appear for a student unless the MIDI subscription is enabled. Each set of MIDI and non-MIDI games will have the same game number, but the MIDI will have a letter suffix of “M”.",,,,
1940,,,,MIDI Completion,,,,,
1941,,,,,"MIDI Completion.  What is needed is a way to present MIDI games and to evaluate completion of student assignments.  If the teacher has a subscription to the MIDI games but the student does not have access to a MIDI device, then we do not want the student blocked from being able to proceed.",,,,
1942,,,,MIDI Sub-Pane,,,,,
1943,,,,,"MIDI Sub-pane.  A suggested approach is to add a MIDI sub-pane to the Assignment Group, indicating that these games “require a MIDI keyboard to be attached”.  If there is a MIDI subscription these games would appear in the pane and would need to be played for completion.  Non-MIDI games for which there was an equivalent MIDI game (same base game number) would not appear in the main assignment pane.",,,,
1944,,,,MIDI Suppression,,,,,
1945,,,,,"MIDI Suppression.  The teacher, at the time of defining the starting named sequence for a student, would also mark if MIDI is to be suppressed.  The default is that if the teacher has a MIDI subscription, the student would automatically get the MIDI games, but the teacher could override this and no MIDI games would appear in the assignment.",,,,
1946,,,,Edit Game Completion,,,,,
1947,,,,,"At any time a teacher has the ability to look at an individual student assignment and mark that individual games are completed, regardless of student score.  When a teacher performs this override the student becomes entitled to execute whatever is in the summary pane, and receives any awards there.",,,,
1948,,,,,"The teacher needs the ability to manage a student with some degree of detail, without requiring the teacher to do so.",,,,
1949,,,,,"[Another approach to MIDI game presentation might be that designation of completion of an assignment is the same as without MIDI games, but if at least one of the MIDI games is played, then the remainder of them must be played in order to complete the assignment.  The logic being that if one game is played, then a MIDI device is available.  We do not think this works as well as what is presented above.]",,,,
1950,,,,,,,,,
1951,,,Student Recess,,,,,,
1952,X,,Update 09-11-12,Game Playing Post-Assignment,,,,,
1953,,,,,"Game Playing.  Outside of his or her lessons, (“student recess”) a student is permitted access to all games, with the exception of the quiz stage games, in his or her current level.  They are also provided an easy way to return to any games previously played in their completed lessons.  ",,,,
1954,,,,Internal Group Level,,,,,
1955,,,,,Internal Group Level.  Every student lesson assignment includes in its definition an internal “group level” (a number 0-7).  This internal group level is set by the Content Administrator when the assignment group is defined.  (It is based upon general pedagogy and expertise.),,,,
1956,,,,Game Level Range,,,,,
1957,,,,,"Game Level Range.  Every game is defined to include an internal “level range” parameter. For example, a game might have an internal level range of 1-3.  This means that the game might be used in more than one group level, specifically 1, 2, or 3.  This “level range” relates to the Sequence Level, but, since external methodologies have a variety of nomenclature, the definition of this “level range” aids in standardization within the learning system.",,,,
1958,,,,Level Comparison,,,,,
1959,,,,,"Level Comparison.  So the system can make a comparison between the internal “group level” of the student’s current assignment, or just completed, and the internal “level range” of any game.",,,,
1960,,,,Current Level Limit,,,,,
1961,,,,,"Limited to Current Level.  A student is not permitted to play games where the game’s defined internal level range does not include the internal group level currently assigned to him or her.  For example, if a student’s current Assignment is in primary level (internal group level = 0), he or she will not be permitted to select and play on their own any games defined to have a level range with the minimum higher than primary level, such as 1-2.",,,,
1962,X,,Update 09-11-12,,This level limitation may be overridden by the teacher in the student's profile,,,,
1963,,,Lesson Skipping,,,,,,
1964,X,,Update 09-11-12,Lesson Skipping,,,,,
1965,,,,,"Lesson Skipping.  A student is allowed to return to previous lesson Assignments by skipping backwards sequentially and repeating any part, or all parts, of an Assignment group.  A student is also allowed to skip forward to the next Assignments, sequentially, even though the current lesson assignment is incomplete.  This skipping is allowed, even if the next lesson assignment has a higher internal level.",,,,
1966,,,,Level Persistence,,,,,
1967,,,,,"Level Persistence.  However, when a student logs in to the system again, he or she is presented with the first lesson in their assigned sequence that has not been completed.  Additionally, even if the student has skipped to a lesson that has a higher internal level than the assigned lesson that is incomplete, the student is considered to still be “at” the level of the incomplete assignment, and therefore at recess cannot play any games above that level.",,,,
1968,,,,Controlled Flexibiltiy,,,,,
1969,,,,,"Controlled Flexibility.  So students have some flexibility to move forward with Assignments, and they can play a variety of games, but there is still significant incentive to complete assignments so that they get the awards, can play challenge games, and can play higher level games during recess.",,,,
1970,,,,,,,,,
1971,,,Student Assessment,Assessment Sequences,,,,,
1972,,,,,Assessment Sequences.  Specific named sequences are provided to teachers to assign to new students for the purpose of assessing their degree of mastery of music concepts.  These sequences are related to internal level ranges and constitute only the quiz games for those “levels”.  These are organized in such a way that the scoring results from the student’s completion indicates at what level they should begin Assignments.  ,,,,
1973,,,,Beginning Level Assignment,,,,,
1974,,,,,"Beginning Level Assignment.  The individual teacher or family administrator may assign a starting position above or below, but the assessment (or pre-test) is a good indicator.",,,,
1975,,,,,,,,,
1976,,,,,"[Probably the way this will be implemented is to present to the teacher or family administrator a report of the scores from the completion of the assessment sequence in the same manner as any other assigned sequence.  Certain totals (yet to be defined) will be presented (to eliminate the need for the teacher to manually perform the calculations).  A separate evaluation algorithm will be presented to the teacher or family administrator, which they can use to arrive at a predicted starting level.  Since we have no actual results from such an algorithm to date we do not want to build in that automation at this time.  In the future we may be able to provide a fully-automated level-assigning pre-test.]",,,,
