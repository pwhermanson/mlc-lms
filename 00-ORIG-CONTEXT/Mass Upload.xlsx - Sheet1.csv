,,,Bulk Student Upload Utility,
,,,Utility to permit upload for ENSEMBLE subscriber of teacher and student information from flat files (csv).,
,,,,
,,,The expectation is that a school IT department will generate student lists and place them in the required format for upload.  The expectation is that this will be a csv (flatfile) placed on the network where the School Administrator may find and access it.,
,,,,
,,,"The utility will handle the upload such that if a field is populated it will be used, but if blank will be ignored as optional information not used.",
,,,"For example, a list of students could be uploaded without a Teacher and then the mass-assign function could be used to assign to teachers later.",
,,,,
,,,,
,,,CSV File Fields:,
,,,,
,Required,1,Student First Name  ,
,Required,2,Student Last Name,
,Required,3,Student User Name,
,,4,Student Password ,
,Optional,5,Active Status ,"(Y for Active, blank for Inactive)"
,Optional,6,Teacher Real Name,
,Optional,7,Course Assignment ID# ,657 is LIFE Primary 1A Assignment 1

,,,"When the School Administrator wishes to upload students, the upload utility is accessed and a selection is made to which Teacher/Classroom the students are to be loaded.  ***",
,,,"A browse feature, or file naming feature, allows the School Administrator to pick which file has the required student name content.",
,,,The upload process will: ***,
,1,,   Upload the Student Last Name to the Student Profile,
,2,,   Upload the Student First Name to the Student Profile,
,3,,   Upload the E-mail address (if found) to the Student Profile,
,4,,   A user name will be created and uploaded to the Student Profile ,
,5,,   A password will be chosen from a standard list and uploaded to the Student Profile,
,,,"If the username creation process results in duplicates (e.g., there are two John Smiths) then the duplicates are resolved by the system automatically adding a letter suffix to the first name before concatenating  (e.g., SmithJohn17502, SmithJohnA17502, SmithJohnB17502). [A BETTER SOLUTION could be considered]",
,,,Following upload individual student profiles may be edited.,
,,,There needs to be a toggle option to allow upload of pre-established usernames and passwords instead of automatic creation.,
,,,"***  Recommendation is that the upload file have an optional Teacher column.  If filled, then the student is assigned to that Teacher--if empty then the student is not assigned a Teacher. Username duplication needs to be addressed in some manner, since they must be unique.  One possibility is the load goes to an interval stage where a ""proposed load file"" is created with ""duplicate usernames"" marked.  The original file could then be edited and the upload tried again.  When the ""proposed load file"" is error-free, it is finally loaded.",
,,,,
,USERNAMES automation,,,
,,,"User names are automatically created by concatenating: the student's lastname, the student's firstname, and the school member number.  For example, for school 17502 and student John Smith the resultant user name would be SmithJohn17502.",
,,,"If the username creation process results in duplicates (e.g., there are two John Smiths) then the duplicates are resolved by the system automatically adding a letter suffix to the first name before concatenating  (e.g., SmithJohn17502, SmithJohnA17502, SmithJohnB17502).",
,,,,
,PASSWORDS automation,,,
,,,"A list of short musical terms is used as the source for automated assignment of passwords.  As student names are entered by the process assignments of passwords are made by successively using the standard passwords until the last is reached, then continuing from the beginning until the student roster is exhausted.",
,,,,
,Standard Password List for mass assignment:,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,"Utility would concatenate 1 & 2 upon upload.  I am showing first and last separate because we may want to change in the future to have first and last separated in the data base--right now alphabetization is by First name.  Perhaps at this point the input to the Real Name field from the utility should be: ""Lastname, Firstname""  That would alphabetize correctly. We can simply advise subscribers that if they input Real Name as lastname first it will automatically be in alpha order.  Open for discussion.  Proposed spec is obtain names as two parts, then concatenate as lastname, firstname in the field.",
,,,,
,,,"I am thinking about the Password.  Schools may not want to list this, or may not have it.  Our old utility sequentially selected from a set of musical terms passwords we created (music, key, sharp, note, hand, piano, flat, black, etc.).  That could work--if we provided a list that could be used. This would be internal and automatically assigned, but could be provided externally as well. (I can provide the list).  (Or perhaps an algorithm could be used to do this in the utility.  If blank, the utility creates a password.  But it would need to be simple, yet not easily guessed by students by analyzing the algorithm ).  A report/student roster (M31-l13) could optionally display the password to make it easy for teachers to communicate to their students.  Open for discussion.  Proposed spec ​is a list of 50 repeating simple passwords that are inserted by the utility.",
,,,,
,,,"Error control.  Suggest simple list of failures or duplicates, with pending processed upload that can be authorized.  So upload could take place and a few fixes manually done, or upload stopped and extensive repairs made.  Duplicate names, usernames, or bad data are the obvious errors.",
