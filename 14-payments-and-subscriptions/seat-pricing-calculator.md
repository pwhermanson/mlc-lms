#### Tier Structure
| Tier | Seat Range | Monthly Base | Per Seat | Annual Base | Per Seat (Annual) |
|------|------------|--------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 20-119 | $19.95 | $0.20 | $239.40 | $2.40 |
| 2 | 120-239 | $39.95 | $0.18 | $479.40 | $2.16 |
| 3 | 240-499 | $61.55 | $0.16 | $738.60 | $1.92 |
