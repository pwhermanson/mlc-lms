# Test Strategy

## Purpose

This document defines the comprehensive testing strategy for the MusicLearningCommunity (MLC) LMS platform. The testing strategy ensures that the platform delivers a reliable, accessible, and high-quality music education experience across all user roles, devices, and browsers.

Given the platform's educational mission and the diverse user base (students ages 6-18, teachers, administrators, system admins), testing must validate not only functional correctness but also:

- **Educational Integrity**: Games, assignments, and progress tracking work correctly to support learning outcomes
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Platform is usable by students with special needs, particularly those on the autism spectrum
- **Multi-Device Support**: Consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers
- **Score Accuracy**: Critical for student motivation and teacher assessment - no score recording failures
- **MIDI/Audio Reliability**: Music input devices and audio playback work consistently across platforms
- **Data Security**: Student data and COPPA/FERPA compliance requirements are maintained
- **Performance at Scale**: System performs well for individual students and large school deployments

This strategy addresses historical pain points from the legacy system, particularly around score recording reliability, browser compatibility issues, and the complexity of testing music-specific features like MIDI input and audio playback.

- Passwords are different in production-like environments for security
- Rotate test passwords quarterly

### Test Game Content

**Sample Games**:
- At least one game for each category (Staff, Rhythm, Keys, etc.)
- Games with different device requirements (any, MIDI required, microphone optional)
- Games with different difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Games with all stage types (Learn, Play, Quiz, Challenge, Review)

**Test Sequences**:
- Short sequence (3-5 games) for quick testing
- Medium sequence (10-15 games) for typical assignment testing
- Long sequence (20+ games) for bulk operations and performance testing
- Sequence aligned with Piano Adventures method
- Custom sequence created by teacher

**Test Assignments**:
- New assignment (not started by student)
- In-progress assignment (student partially complete)
- Completed assignment (all stages finished)
- Overdue assignment (past due date)
- Assignment with multiple students

### Database Seeding

**Development Environment**:
- Seed script creates test users, games, sequences, assignments
- Reproducible seed data (same every time script runs)
- Quick reset for fresh start during development
- Include representative data volumes (100 students, 50 games, 20 sequences)

**Staging Environment**:
- Anonymized production data (preferred for realistic testing)
- Or synthetic data matching production patterns
- Refresh weekly to keep data current
- Larger data volumes (1,000 students, 200 games, 100 sequences)

**CI Environment**:
- Minimal seed data for fast test execution
- Focused on test coverage, not data volume
- Ephemeral database destroyed after tests
- Fresh seed on every test run

## Telemetry and Test Observability

Testing generates valuable telemetry for monitoring test health and identifying issues:

**Test Execution Metrics**:
- Test duration (total and per test)
- Test pass/fail rates over time
- Flaky test identification (tests that fail intermittently)
- Code coverage trends
- Test count growth over time

**Application Telemetry During Testing** (see [Event Model](../15-analytics-and-reporting/event-model.md)):
- **Test Environment Events**: All analytics events should fire in test environments
- **Event Validation**: Verify events contain expected properties
- **Event Timing**: Ensure events fire at correct points in user flows
- **Event Volume**: Monitor for missing or duplicated events

**Performance Telemetry**:
- API response times during test execution
- Database query performance
- Browser rendering performance (Lighthouse CI)
- Memory leaks during long test runs

**Tools**:
- **GitHub Actions**: Test execution metrics and history
- **Codecov or Coveralls**: Code coverage tracking and trends
- **Datadog or New Relic**: Application performance during testing (optional)
- **Custom Dashboards**: Visualize test metrics over time

## Open Questions

**Test Automation Tooling**:
- **Q**: Playwright vs. Cypress for E2E testing?
  - **Context**: Both are viable. Playwright offers better cross-browser support and parallel execution. Cypress offers superior developer experience and debugging.
  - **Decision Needed**: Team preference based on experience and requirements.

- **Q**: Visual regression testing: Percy, Chromatic, or self-hosted?
  - **Context**: Percy and Chromatic are SaaS tools with excellent integration. Self-hosted is possible with tools like BackstopJS or Loki.
  - **Decision Needed**: Budget and control trade-offs.

**Test Data Management**:
- **Q**: Should staging use anonymized production data or synthetic data?
  - **Context**: Anonymized production data is more realistic but requires privacy-safe anonymization process. Synthetic data is safer but may miss edge cases.
  - **Decision Needed**: Legal and compliance review required.

- **Q**: How often should test data be refreshed in staging?
  - **Context**: More frequent refreshes keep tests realistic but add maintenance overhead.
  - **Decision Needed**: Balance freshness with stability (weekly refresh is proposed).

**Music-Specific Testing**:
- **Q**: How to automate MIDI keyboard testing without physical hardware?
  - **Context**: Mocking Web MIDI API works for unit tests but doesn't catch browser compatibility issues or real hardware problems.
  - **Options**: (1) Manual testing only, (2) USB MIDI device in CI environment, (3) Hybrid approach.
  - **Decision Needed**: Cost-benefit analysis of automation investment.

- **Q**: What audio quality metrics should we track during testing?
  - **Context**: Subjective audio quality is hard to test automatically. Latency is measurable, but "good enough" quality is subjective.
  - **Decision Needed**: Define objective metrics (latency, synchronization) and manual listening test protocols.

**Accessibility Testing**:
- **Q**: How frequently should we conduct user testing with special needs students?
  - **Context**: Real user feedback is invaluable but requires careful coordination with schools and parents.
  - **Proposed**: Quarterly testing sessions with 5-10 students.
  - **Decision Needed**: Budget and logistics planning.

**Performance Testing**:
- **Q**: What are acceptable performance baselines for different user segments?
  - **Context**: Users on slow connections or older devices may have different expectations.
  - **Decision Needed**: Define p50, p75, p95 targets for different segments (fast home broadband, school WiFi, mobile 4G).

**Security Testing**:
- **Q**: How often should we conduct penetration testing?
  - **Context**: Annual pen testing is common, but semi-annual or quarterly may be appropriate given student data sensitivity.
  - **Decision Needed**: Budget and risk tolerance.

**CI/CD Pipeline**:
- **Q**: Should E2E tests block merge or be advisory?
  - **Context**: Blocking on E2E failures prevents regressions but can slow development if tests are flaky. Advisory allows merge but risks production issues.
  - **Decision Needed**: Team agrees on acceptable trade-off.

- **Q**: What percentage of E2E tests should run on every PR vs. nightly only?
  - **Context**: Running full E2E suite on every PR is slow (30-40 minutes). Running only critical path is faster but may miss regressions.
  - **Proposed**: Critical path (10-15 tests, ~10 minutes) on every PR, full suite nightly.
  - **Decision Needed**: Confirm this balance is acceptable.

**Test Maintenance**:
- **Q**: Who is responsible for maintaining E2E tests when they break due to UI changes?
  - **Context**: E2E tests are brittle and require maintenance when UI changes. Clear ownership prevents test neglect.
  - **Options**: (1) QA team owns, (2) Developer who changed UI owns, (3) Shared ownership.
  - **Decision Needed**: Define ownership model and escalation path.

**Monitoring and Alerting**:
- **Q**: Should we alert on test failures or review them proactively?
  - **Context**: Alerting on every test failure can cause alert fatigue. Proactive review (daily standup) may miss urgent issues.
  - **Proposed**: Alert on repeated failures (3+ in a row) or critical path test failures. Review all failures daily.
  - **Decision Needed**: Confirm alerting strategy.
