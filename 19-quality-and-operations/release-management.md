## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Decision Criteria

**Immediate Rollback (No Discussion Required)**:
- Score recording failures (any student scores not persisting)
- Authentication system failures (users cannot log in)
- Payment processing failures (money charged but subscription not activated)
- Data corruption or loss detected
- Security vulnerability actively exploited

**Rollback Requiring Discussion (15-minute emergency meeting)**:
- Significant feature broken but core functionality working
- Performance degradation (p95 response time > 2x baseline)
- High error rates (> 5% of requests) but no data loss
- External integration failures with workarounds available

**Monitor Without Rollback**:
- Minor UI bugs with no functional impact
- Isolated issues affecting < 1% of users
- Non-critical features broken (leaderboards, badges) with core functionality intact

### Rollback Procedure

#### Vercel Instant Rollback (< 5 minutes)

**When to Use**: Application-level issues, no database schema changes

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to Vercel dashboard → Deployments
2. Find previous stable deployment (marked with green checkmark)
3. Click "Promote to Production"
4. Confirm rollback
5. Verify previous version is live (check deployment URL)
6. Run smoke tests to confirm functionality restored

**Vercel automatically**:
- Routes traffic to previous deployment
- Preserves all previous deployments for instant recovery
- No downtime during rollback

#### Database Rollback (30-60 minutes)

**When to Use**: Database migrations caused issues, data integrity problems

**Steps**:
1. **Stop Application Traffic**
   - Enable maintenance mode in Vercel
   - Display "System Maintenance" page to users

2. **Restore Database** (choose one):
   - **Option A - Migration Rollback**: Run down migrations to revert schema
   - **Option B - Snapshot Restore**: Restore from Neon automatic backup (last known good state)

3. **Verify Database State**
   - Run validation queries
   - Check data integrity constraints
   - Confirm schema matches application expectations

4. **Rollback Application**
   - Follow Vercel instant rollback procedure
   - Ensure application version matches database schema

5. **Resume Traffic**
   - Disable maintenance mode
   - Run smoke tests
   - Monitor error rates

6. **Data Recovery** (if needed)
   - Identify data lost between backup and rollback time
   - Manually reconcile recent transactions (payment records, scores)
   - Communicate with affected users

**Note**: Database rollbacks are high-risk. Prefer forward fixes (deploying a patch) when possible.

### Rollback Communication

**Internal**:
- Immediate Slack/Teams notification: "Production rollback initiated"
- Post-rollback email: What was rolled back, why, and next steps
- Incident report created (see [Incident Response](incident-response.md))

**External**:
- Status page update: "Service restored to previous version"
- Email to subscribers (if user-facing impact): Brief explanation and timeline
- Support team briefing: FAQs and customer communication template

---

## Hotfix Process

### When to Use Hotfix Process

**Hotfix Criteria**:
- Critical bug in production requiring immediate fix
- Cannot wait for next standard release cycle
- Risk of leaving unfixed outweighs risk of expedited deployment

**Examples**:
- Score recording failures
- Authentication bypass vulnerability
- Payment overcharging users
- Data export exposing PII

### Hotfix Workflow

#### Expedited Timeline (2-4 hours)

**Hour 1: Development and Testing**

1. **Create Hotfix Branch** (5 minutes)
   - Branch from current production `main`: `hotfix/v1.2.4-critical-score-fix`
   - Apply minimal fix (smallest possible change)
   - Update version number (patch increment)

2. **Local Testing** (20 minutes)
   - Write test case reproducing the bug
   - Verify fix resolves issue
   - Run full unit test suite
   - Run integration tests for affected area

3. **Code Review** (15 minutes)
   - Emergency PR review by at least one senior engineer
   - Focus on fix correctness and potential side effects
   - Document why hotfix was needed

4. **Deploy to Staging** (10 minutes)
   - Deploy hotfix branch to Vercel preview
   - Run smoke tests
   - Manually validate fix on staging

**Hour 2: Approval and Deployment**

5. **Approval Chain** (10 minutes)
   - Engineering Lead: Technical review
   - QA Lead: Test validation
   - Product Owner: Business impact assessment
   - Document decision in incident report

6. **Production Deployment** (10 minutes)
   - Merge hotfix branch to `main`
   - Vercel auto-deploys to production
   - Monitor deployment progress

7. **Post-Deployment Validation** (30 minutes)
   - Run smoke tests on production
   - Manually verify fix works in production
   - Monitor error rates and logs
   - Confirm issue resolved for affected users

**Hours 3-4: Communication and Documentation**

8. **User Communication**
   - Status page update: Issue resolved
   - Email affected users (if identifiable)
   - Internal team notification

9. **Incident Documentation**
   - Complete incident report (see [Incident Response](incident-response.md))
   - Update runbook with lessons learned
   - Schedule post-mortem if warranted

10. **Backport to Release Branch** (if applicable)
    - Cherry-pick hotfix to active release branch
    - Ensure fix included in next standard release

### Hotfix Quality Gates (Reduced but not eliminated)

- ✅ Fix verified on local environment
- ✅ Unit tests passing
- ✅ Integration tests passing for affected module
- ✅ Manual validation on staging
- ✅ Code review complete (1 reviewer minimum)
- ✅ Approval from Engineering Lead and QA Lead
- ✅ Rollback plan identified

**Trade-off**: Hotfixes prioritize speed over comprehensive testing. Monitor closely after deployment.

## Behavior and Rules

### Release Planning Rules

#### Version Numbering
- **Semantic Versioning**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`)
  - **Major**: Breaking changes, database schema breaking changes, major feature launches
  - **Minor**: New features, non-breaking enhancements
  - **Patch**: Bug fixes, dependency updates, configuration changes
  
- **Pre-release Versions**: Use `-rc.N` suffix for release candidates (e.g., `1.2.3-rc.1`)
- **Hotfix Versions**: Increment patch version immediately (e.g., `1.2.3` → `1.2.4`)

#### Code Freeze Rules
- Once release branch created, only bug fixes merged
- Feature development continues on `main` for next release
- Critical fixes cherry-picked to release branch if needed
- No direct commits to release branch (PRs only)

#### Deployment Windows
- **Preferred**: Thursday 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM Pacific (low student usage)
- **Avoid**: 
  - Monday mornings (high teacher activity planning week)
  - Friday evenings (limited support staff availability)
  - School year start/end weeks (high usage, low tolerance for issues)
  - Major holidays

### Quality Gate Rules

#### Blocking Issues
- **Severity 1 Bugs**: Block deployment until resolved
  - Data loss or corruption
  - Score recording failures
  - Authentication/authorization bypass
  - Payment processing errors
  
- **Severity 2 Bugs**: Block deployment unless workaround exists
  - Major feature broken but system usable
  - Performance degradation (2x slower than baseline)
  - Accessibility violations (WCAG A-level)

#### Performance Thresholds (Must Meet Before Deployment)
- **API Response Times**: p95 < 500ms, p99 < 1000ms
- **Page Load Times**: p95 < 2s (First Contentful Paint), < 3s (Largest Contentful Paint)
- **Database Query Performance**: No queries > 500ms
- **Error Rates**: < 0.5% for all endpoints

#### Security Requirements
- All dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- No critical or high severity vulnerabilities
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities addressed
- Secrets rotation completed if credential changes

### Rollback Rules

#### Automatic Rollback Triggers (If Implemented)
- Error rate exceeds 10% for more than 5 minutes
- p95 response time exceeds 5s for more than 5 minutes
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- Critical endpoint (login, score recording) failure rate > 1%

**Note**: Automatic rollback requires careful configuration to avoid false positives. Start with manual rollback process.

#### Post-Rollback Actions
1. **Immediate**: Create incident report (see [Incident Response](incident-response.md))
2. **Within 24 hours**: Identify root cause
3. **Within 48 hours**: Deploy forward fix or schedule retry
4. **Within 1 week**: Post-mortem and process improvements

### Feature Flag Rules

For major releases or high-risk changes:

- **Gradual Rollout**: Enable feature for increasing percentages (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
- **Rollout Duration**: Monitor at each stage for at least 15 minutes before increasing
- **User Segmentation**: Consider enabling first for internal users, then beta testers, then general users
- **Kill Switch**: Feature flags must support instant disable without redeployment
- **Monitoring**: Each feature flag should have associated metrics dashboard

### Release Health Metrics (Post-Deployment)

Monitor these metrics in [Observability](observability.md) dashboards:

- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests (target: < 0.5%)
- **Response Time**: p50, p95, p99 response times (target: p95 < 500ms)
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Active Users**: Concurrent active users
- **Score Recording Success Rate**: Percentage of successful score saves (target: 99.5%+)
- **Assignment Completion Rate**: Percentage of assignments successfully completed
- **Database Query Performance**: Slow query count and average query time
- **External Service Health**: Uptime percentage for Braintree, email provider

## Open Questions

### Process Refinement
- **Canary Deployments**: Should we implement canary deployments (deploy to subset of servers first)? How to implement with Vercel?
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Would blue-green deployment strategy reduce risk for major releases?
- **Automated Rollback**: At what error rate/response time thresholds should automatic rollback trigger? How to prevent false positives?

### Communication
- **User Notifications**: Should we notify all users of every release, or only when user-facing changes?
- **Beta Testing Program**: Should we formalize a beta tester program for early access to releases?
- **Maintenance Windows**: Do we need longer maintenance windows for major releases with downtime?

### Tooling
- **Feature Flag Service**: Should we use a dedicated feature flag service (LaunchDarkly, etc.) or build in-house?
- **Release Dashboard**: Do we need a custom release management dashboard or is Vercel + GitHub sufficient?
- **Automated Changelog Generation**: Can we automate release notes from commit messages and PR descriptions?

### Education-Specific Considerations
- **School Calendar Awareness**: Should deployment schedule consider school calendar (avoid testing weeks, parent-teacher conferences)?
- **User Training**: For major UI changes, how much advance notice and training materials do teachers/admins need?
- **Score Integrity**: Additional validation steps needed for releases affecting score recording or progress tracking?
