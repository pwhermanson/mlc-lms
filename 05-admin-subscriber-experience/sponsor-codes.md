# Sponsor Codes

## Purpose

This document defines the sponsor code management interface and workflows for Subscriber-Admins within the MLC-LMS platform. It covers the administrative tools, user experience flows, and business processes that enable subscribers to manage sponsor codes through the Christine Hermanson Grant Program, facilitating philanthropic support for music education.

Unlike promotional codes which are marketing tools, sponsor codes are relationship-based codes that create connections between Ensemble Members and educational institutions, enabling direct support of music education in schools.

## Scope

### Included
- Administrative interface for sponsor code management and assignment
- Christine Hermanson Grant Program workflow integration
- Sponsor-sponsee relationship tracking and management
- Integration with subscriber dashboard and billing systems
- User experience flows for code assignment and redemption
- Reporting and impact metrics for sponsored subscriptions

### Excluded
- Technical implementation details (see [Sponsor Codes Implementation](../14-payments-and-subscriptions/sponsor-codes-impl.md))
- System-wide sponsor code management (see [System Admin Tools](../06-system-admin/sysadmin-billing-tools.md))
- Christine Hermanson Grant Program policy details (see [Company History](../00-foundations/company-history.md))

## Christine Hermanson Grant Program Context

### Program Foundation
The Christine Hermanson Grant Program was established in honor of the platform's founder, Christine Hermanson, who dedicated her occupational life to music education, particularly early learners. As a nationally-recognized pioneer in music education technology, her teaching philosophy included the conviction that anyone could learn, make, and enjoy musicâ€”that music is an integral part of every individual's experience.

### Program Purpose
The program encourages early learners in music education by providing schools with free subscriptions to MusicLearningCommunity.com for General Music classes through a simple sponsor program. This reflects Christine's discovery that computer technology could be very effective, particularly in learning music literacy.

### How It Works
- **Automatic Sponsorship**: Anyone who subscribes to the ENSEMBLE level (including a school) automatically becomes a sponsor
- **Free Solo Subscription**: Sponsors can provide a free SOLO subscription (of 5 seats) to be used for General Music
- **Ongoing Support**: As long as the ENSEMBLE subscription is active, the free sponsored subscription remains active
- **Unique Sponsor Code**: Each new Ensemble Member receives a unique "sponsor code" for assignment
