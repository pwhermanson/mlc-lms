# Admin Notifications

## Purpose
Enable subscriber administrators and teacher-admins to receive timely, relevant notifications about organizational activities, billing events, user management tasks, and system updates that require their attention. This system ensures administrators stay informed about critical subscription health, user activities, and administrative responsibilities while respecting their notification preferences and avoiding information overload.

## Scope
**Included**
- Subscription and billing notifications (payment issues, plan changes, seat utilization)
- User management alerts (new registrations, role changes, account issues)
- System announcements and maintenance notifications
- Educational oversight notifications (teacher performance, student engagement trends)
- Security and compliance alerts
- Administrative task reminders and overdue items
- Emergency communications and urgent system alerts
- Notification preferences and delivery channel management

**Excluded**
- Individual student progress notifications (handled in teacher experience)
- Cross-organization notifications (system admin level only)
- Technical system operational alerts (handled by system admin)
- Student-to-student communications (not supported)

## Data Model
Reference: `../15-analytics-and-reporting/event-model.md` (events), `../13-messaging-and-notifications/in-app-notifications.md` (delivery), `../02-roles-and-permissions/permissions-table.md` (permissions)

### Core Entities
- **AdminNotification**: `notificationId`, `adminId`, `type`, `title`, `message`, `priority`, `readStatus`, `createdAt`, `expiresAt`, `organizationId`
- **NotificationPreference**: `adminId`, `channel`, `type`, `enabled`, `frequency`, `quietHours`
- **SubscriptionAlert**: `alertId`, `subscriptionId`, `alertType`, `severity`, `context`, `resolvedAt`
- **SystemAnnouncement**: `announcementId`, `title`, `message`, `priority`, `targetRoles[]`, `publishedAt`, `expiresAt`

### Notification Types
- `billing_payment_failed`: Payment processing failed or declined
- `billing_payment_success`: Successful payment confirmation
- `subscription_expiring`: Subscription approaching expiration
- `seat_limit_approaching`: Seat utilization near capacity
- `seat_limit_exceeded`: Seat utilization exceeded
- `new_user_registration`: New user added to organization
- `user_role_changed`: User role or permissions modified
- `teacher_performance_alert`: Teacher needs attention (low engagement, inactive)
- `student_engagement_trend`: Significant changes in student activity patterns
- `system_maintenance`: Scheduled maintenance notifications
- `system_announcement`: General system updates and news
- `security_alert`: Security-related notifications
- `compliance_reminder`: Regulatory or policy compliance reminders
- `emergency_alert`: Urgent system or safety notifications

## Behavior and Rules

### Notification Generation
- Subscriber-Admins receive notifications for their entire organization
- Teacher-Admins receive notifications for their assigned scope (see `../02-roles-and-permissions/roles-matrix.md`)
- Notifications are generated based on organizational events and system activities
- Duplicate notifications are prevented through deduplication logic
- Notifications respect organizational hierarchy and permission boundaries

### Priority Levels
- `critical`: Emergency alerts, security breaches, payment failures (immediate delivery)
- `high`: Billing issues, seat limit exceeded, user management problems (delivered within 1 hour)
- `normal`: New user registrations, routine system updates (delivered within 4 hours)
- `low`: General announcements, maintenance notifications (delivered within 24 hours)

### Delivery Channels
- **In-app notifications**: Always enabled, accessible from admin dashboard
- **Email notifications**: Based on admin preferences, includes actionable links
- **Push notifications**: For mobile app users (if enabled)
- **SMS notifications**: For critical alerts only, requires opt-in

### Notification Preferences
- Admins can customize which notification types they receive
- Channel preferences can be set per notification type
- Frequency controls: immediate, daily digest, weekly digest, disabled
- Quiet hours can be configured to avoid notifications during specific times
- Organization-level notification policies can override individual preferences

### Retention and Cleanup
- Read notifications are retained for 30 days
- Unread notifications are retained for 90 days
- Critical notifications are retained for 1 year for audit purposes
- Automatic cleanup of expired notifications
- Compliance notifications retained per regulatory requirements

## UX Requirements

### Notification Center
- Accessible from admin dashboard header with unread count badge
- List view with notification type icons, timestamps, and read/unread states
- Filtering by notification type, priority, and date range
- Bulk actions for marking multiple notifications as read
- Search functionality for finding specific notifications

### Notification Display
- Clear visual hierarchy with priority indicators
- Actionable notifications include relevant buttons or links
- Rich text support for formatted messages
- Attachment support for relevant documents or reports
- Dismissible notifications with confirmation for critical alerts

### Mobile Experience
- Responsive design for mobile admin access
- Push notification support with proper categorization
- Offline notification queuing for when connectivity is restored
- Touch-friendly interaction patterns

## Telemetry
Reference: `../15-analytics-and-reporting/event-model.md`

### Events Tracked

## Open Questions
- Should admins be able to create custom notification rules based on specific criteria?

- What is the appropriate frequency for digest notifications to avoid overwhelming admins?
- Should there be notification templates for common administrative communications?
- How should emergency notifications be prioritized when multiple critical alerts occur simultaneously?
