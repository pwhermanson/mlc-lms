# Student Bulk Operations

## Purpose
Comprehensive bulk management tools for Subscriber-Admins and Teacher-Admins to efficiently manage large numbers of students within their organizations. This system enables mass student creation, modification, assignment, and management operations that are essential for schools and institutions with hundreds or thousands of students.

The bulk operations system addresses the critical need for efficient student lifecycle management in educational institutions, reducing administrative overhead and enabling rapid deployment of student accounts at the beginning of academic terms or when onboarding new students.

## Scope
This specification covers all bulk operations related to student management within the MLC-LMS platform, including:

**Included:**
- Bulk student account creation and import
- Mass student data modification and updates
- Bulk student assignment to teachers and classes
- Mass student status changes (activation, suspension, deactivation)
- Bulk student data export and reporting
- CSV import/export functionality with validation
- Bulk communication and notification management
- Mass assignment of learning sequences and content
- Bulk student progress and analytics operations

**Excluded:**
- Individual student account management (covered in [Member Management](./member-management.md))
- Teacher bulk operations (covered in [Mass Assignments](./mass-assignments.md))
- Billing and subscription bulk operations (covered in [Billing Plans and Seats](../14-payments-and-subscriptions/billing-plans-and-seats.md))
- System-wide administrative operations (covered in [System Admin](../06-system-admin/) documentation)
