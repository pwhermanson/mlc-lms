# Mass Assignments

## Purpose

Mass Assignments enable Subscriber-Admins, Teacher-Admins, and Teachers to efficiently assign learning content (sequences, assignments, courses) to multiple students simultaneously. This system addresses the critical need for scalable content distribution in educational settings, eliminating the need for repetitive one-by-one assignment operations that are time-consuming and error-prone.

The mass assignment system empowers educators to:
- Deploy curriculum-wide learning sequences to entire classes or grade levels at the start of academic terms
- Quickly assign remediation content to groups of struggling students
- Distribute seasonal or time-bound content (e.g., holiday-themed games, assessment prep) to multiple cohorts
- Reassign students to different teachers or grade levels with their associated content
- Maintain pedagogical consistency across multiple student groups by using templates

This functionality was identified in Phase 2 specifications for MLC-4.0 as a critical workflow improvement for school environments, where efficiently moving entire grades of students between teachers or assigning standardized sequences at scale is essential for operational success.
