This biography documents Christine's journey from traditional music educator to technology pioneer, highlighting her role in establishing music education technology as a legitimate and effective teaching methodology.

## Early Life and Musical Foundation

### Musical Beginnings
Born in Lansing, Michigan, Christine Morton grew up in Muskegon, Michigan, where she began music lessons at an early age with Irene Kolkema, a church organist. An honors student throughout her academic career, Christine excelled on piano and participated actively in school vocal programs. Her musical talent and dedication led her to become the accompanist for her high school choir, demonstrating both technical proficiency and leadership qualities that would define her professional career.

### Academic Excellence
Christine pursued her passion for music education at the University of Michigan Music School, earning a Bachelor of Music with K-12 teaching certification and minors in Piano Performance and voice. This comprehensive musical education provided the foundation for her later innovations in music education technology, combining performance expertise with pedagogical knowledge.

## Professional Career and Innovation

### Early Teaching Success
Christine's teaching career began in Traverse City, Michigan, where she became the first student to complete her University of Michigan degree at the extension program at Interlochen Fine Arts Academy. She completed her student teaching in Traverse City public schools and was immediately offered a position as Choir Director in the Junior High School, demonstrating her exceptional teaching abilities from the start.

### The Florida Music School Empire
Following her husband Bill's entrepreneurial ventures, Christine established a private music teaching practice in Sarasota, Florida that became remarkably successful. She became active in music teacher organizations, making life-long friendships, and performed with the Sarasota Symphony at the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall.

Christine's music school grew to hundreds of students with twelve teachers involved, offering piano, voice, Suzuki violin, band instruments, harp, and summer art programs. Unbeknownst to her at the time, she had created one of the largest successful private music schools in the country, demonstrating her exceptional organizational and educational leadership abilities.

## Technology Pioneer and Industry Leadership

### Early Technology Adoption
The advent of the personal computer in the 1980s marked a pivotal moment in Christine's career. When Bill discovered a software program created by the Minnesota Computing Consortium featuring music games, the couple discussed adding technology to music teaching. Despite still renting houses, they took money intended for a real estate purchase and instead invested in an Apple IIe and simple music education software.

This decision proved transformative, as Christine became one of the earliest adopters of music education technology, experimenting with what worked and what didn't in music education. She became acquainted with early pioneers in music education technology, including Roger and Diane McRea of Temporal Acuity Products, who provided TAP Master and Pitch Master systems and Micro Music Software Library.

### National Recognition and Industry Impact
Christine's extensive experimentation and industry contacts resulted in specific knowledge she was excited to share with her peers. Her contact with industry pioneers and personal experience applying new technology in her studio convinced her that proper application could greatly aid music students and that the world of music education was changing.

She gave numerous presentations at music teacher organization events and made more contacts within the music technology industry. The music school now included multiple electronic keyboards used in partner piano lessons, multiple computers, various pieces of music education software, and technology integrated into piano and voice curricula.

### MTNA National Leadership
Active in the Music Teachers National Association (MTNA), Christine became the national specialist for MTNA, organizing and conducting the National Symposium on Technology in Music that preceded the MTNA national conference each year. She directed this symposium for seventeen years (1988-2003), uniting private teachers, music industry, and software industry participants in exploring and using music education technology.

Many teachers teaching today were introduced to new technology at these symposia, making Christine one of the most influential figures in music education technology adoption nationwide.

## Product Development and Industry Partnerships

### Software Evaluation and Industry Guidance
As the music technology industry grew and became more competitive, there was a need to help music teachers understand what worked and what didn't. Software pieces could sit side by side on store shelves, with one being very valuable and effective while another was almost worthless. Just because something was "computerized" didn't mean it was "better" or that it "worked."

Since Christine was continually asked about her experiences and found few good sources of information, she published a book that evaluated numerous pieces of software and offered effectiveness ratings. This helped other music teachers adopting new technology make informed decisions about what to invest in and what to avoid.

### Industry Partnerships and Product Development
With Temporal Acuity products, Christine became a partner participant in developing Pianoworks, the first MIDI piano teaching system. These early versions were followed by the Musicware products "Piano" and "Sing," sold worldwide and sitting on computer software store shelves right next to Microsoft and Apple products.

### Academic Pursuit and Innovation
After directing the MTNA Symposium for seventeen years, Christine concentrated on pursuing an idea that had been developing for several years. She wanted to create software to support music education that she could control and develop without computer programmer help, would be economical for the music teacher, would make effective use of technology, and could be kept current.

To pursue this, she enrolled at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville and earned a Masters of Science in Instructional Technology. As her final project, she created MusicLearningCommunity.com games using Adobe Flash. She graduated with a 4.0 GPA, demonstrating her commitment to both innovation and academic excellence.

## Educational Philosophy and Teaching Approach

### The Lifetime Musician Vision
Christine's educational philosophy centered on developing "Lifetime Musicians" - active participants in music-making, not spectators. She believed that Lifetime Musicians have a music "skill-set" broad enough to be able to learn new music without having to listen to a recording. These musicians can read, write, think and create in the universal language of music, and can continue learning new music on their own for a lifetime of music enjoyment.

### Technology as a Teaching Tool
Christine's approach to technology in music education was always pedagogical first, technological second. She believed that the cornerstone of a Lifetime Musician is the guidance of a dedicated, professional music teacher who understands the multi-dimensional nature of music training. This teacher follows a comprehensive music curriculum that trains the eye, the ear and the fingers, and develops higher order thought processes.

She discovered that music listening and reading skills are quickly learned and mastered when presented and practiced through multimedia instructional games. Students work independently, at their own pace, and as each skill is mastered, the teacher guides the student to apply the skills in higher levels of music performance.

### Mastery-Based Learning Design
Christine's games were designed to teach very specific concepts with a goal toward mastery of each concept. This method of delivering very small bites of information has been proven very effective. To determine mastery, the games include automatic quantitative scoring, providing a specific measure of degree of mastery of a concept. When the student achieves the target score, their mastery of the concept is almost certain.

## Professional Recognition and Media Coverage

### National Media Recognition
Christine received significant recognition for her pioneering work. The New York Times described her as "a giant of multimedia music who began her work on education computer programs 18 years ago" in April 1998. This recognition came during her tenure as a leading expert in music education technology.

### Industry Publications and Influence
Christine authored numerous publications that became industry standards:
- Ten interactive, multimedia, MIDI music teaching systems that comprise the Musicware PIANO Series
- Alfred Adult Piano Course for Windows Level I and Level II
- Musicware SING!
- Master Musician Music Literacy Curriculum

She was featured in the college textbook, "Experiencing Music Technology" by David Williams and Peter Webster (Schirmer) from 1990-1998, further establishing her as a recognized authority in the field.

### Academic and Professional Consulting
Christine served as instructional technology consultant to public school districts and university music faculty throughout the US. She served as guest instructor for numerous universities, teaching masters-level seminars in music technology since 1985. She also served as the Technology Coordinator for MTNA and designed, organized and conducted the week-long MTNA National Symposium on Technology in Music.
