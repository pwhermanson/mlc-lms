# Company History

## Overview
Historical context and evolution of MusicLearningCommunity.com from its founding to present day, documenting key milestones, product development phases, and organizational growth. This comprehensive history traces the journey from Christine Hermanson's early experiments with music education technology in the 1980s to the current multi-platform learning community serving students worldwide.

## Description
This document captures the rich history of MLC, including Christine Hermanson's pioneering work in music education technology, the evolution of the platform from its 2005 origins, and the journey that led to the current system redesign. The story encompasses nearly four decades of innovation in music education technology, from early Apple IIe experiments to today's sophisticated web-based learning platform.

## Early Foundations (1980s-2005)

### Christine Hermanson's Musical Journey
Born in Lansing, Michigan, Christine Morton grew up in Muskegon, Michigan, where she began music lessons at an early age with Irene Kolkema, a church organist. An honors student, Christine excelled on piano and participated in school vocal programs, later becoming the accompanist for her high school choir. She pursued her passion at the University of Michigan Music School, earning a Bachelor of Music with K-12 teaching certification and minors in Piano Performance and voice.

### The Partnership Begins
During her college years, Christine met William Hermanson, a senior at her high school who was also an honors student. Bill participated in men's choir, played clarinet in the Symphony Band, and served as drum major. He attended the University of Michigan pursuing an engineering degree, participating in the University of Michigan marching band, before changing majors to economics and business, graduating with honors from Grand Valley State University.

### Early Teaching and Business Ventures
After their marriage, the couple lived in Ann Arbor where Bill worked as a consultant for the University of Michigan. When his position required a move to Traverse City, Michigan, Christine became the first student to complete her University of Michigan degree at the extension program at Interlochen Fine Arts Academy. She completed her student teaching in Traverse City public schools and was immediately offered a position as Choir Director in the Junior High School.

### The Florida Years and Music School Success
Bill's entrepreneurial inclinations and Christine's family move to Florida led them to Sarasota, where Bill started a swimming pool construction company while Christine established a private music teaching practice. This became remarkably successful, with Christine becoming active in music teacher organizations and performing with the Sarasota Symphony at the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall.

Christine's music school grew to hundreds of students with twelve teachers involved, offering piano, voice, Suzuki violin, band instruments, harp, and summer art programs. Unbeknownst to her at the time, she had created one of the largest successful private music schools in the country.

### The Technology Revolution Begins
Around this time, the advent of the personal computer offered new opportunities. Bill discovered a software program created by the Minnesota Computing Consortium featuring music games, and the couple discussed adding technology to music teaching. This proved to be a pivotal moment.

Despite still renting houses, Bill and Christine took money intended for a real estate purchase and instead invested in an Apple IIe and simple music education software. This became part of Christine's private teaching and then part of the music school.

### Early Industry Leadership
With Bill's technical background and Christine's musical expertise, this new technology received extensive use. Christine sought more software as it was being developed, experimenting to determine what worked in music education. She became acquainted with early pioneers in music education technology, including Roger and Diane McRea of Temporal Acuity Products, who provided TAP Master and Pitch Master systems and Micro Music Software Library.

These electronic devices proved extremely successful in teaching rhythm and pitch, with Christine witnessing dramatic results in her own studio. As she experimented and sought more technology, she became acquainted with other software start-up companies and became a beta tester for several of them.

### National Recognition and Industry Impact
Christine's extensive contacts and experiences resulted in specific knowledge she was excited to share with her peers. Her contact with industry pioneers and personal experience applying new technology in her studio convinced her that proper application could greatly aid music students and that the world of music education was changing.

She gave numerous presentations at music teacher organization events and made more contacts within the music technology industry. The music school now included multiple electronic keyboards used in partner piano lessons, multiple computers, various pieces of music education software, and technology integrated into piano and voice curricula. Bill used a computer and early spreadsheet software (Visi-calc) to produce student billing and teacher payroll.

### The Need for Industry Guidance
As the music technology industry grew and became more competitive, there was a need to help music teachers understand what worked and what didn't. Software pieces could sit side by side on store shelves, with one being very valuable and effective while another was almost worthless. Just because something was "computerized" didn't mean it was "better" or that it "worked."

Since Christine was continually asked about her experiences and found few good sources of information, she published a book that evaluated numerous pieces of software and offered effectiveness ratings. This helped other music teachers adopting new technology make informed decisions about what to invest in and what to avoid.

### MTNA National Leadership
Active in the Music Teachers National Association (MTNA), Christine began making presentations nationally as well as locally on music education technology use. She became the national specialist for MTNA, organizing and conducting the National Symposium on Technology in Music that preceded the MTNA national conference each year. Teachers paid extra to arrive early and participate in the Symposium, which united private teachers, music industry, and software industry participants in exploring and using music education technology.

Many teachers teaching today were introduced to new technology at these symposia, which Christine directed for seventeen years.

### Industry Partnerships and Product Development
With Temporal Acuity products, Christine became a partner participant in developing Pianoworks, the first MIDI piano teaching system. These early versions were followed by the Musicware products "Piano" and "Sing," sold worldwide and sitting on computer software store shelves right next to Microsoft and Apple products.

### Industry Challenges and Adaptation
The software industry experienced dramatic advances and failures as competitive and economic forces worked. After making a huge investment to re-tool Musicware Piano for Windows 95, Microsoft delayed its implementation and Musicware went out of business several years later. The cost for software producers to keep up with technology changes in a competitive (and relatively small) music market became excessive, and many early pioneers closed shop.

Despite being in the middle of this turmoil, Christine and Bill remained convinced of the effectiveness of applying the right technology in music education and had seen many successes.

## The St. Louis Years and Family Growth

### A New Chapter Begins
Changes occurred with the Hermanson family as they moved to St. Louis. Bill had again changed careers, becoming Controller for a private school in St. Louis. Their oldest son, Eric, was enrolled there as a high school freshman at age 12. Eric was clearly an advanced student who needed a special environment to thrive. He was already benefiting from innate talent and quality instruction in music and was an accomplished pianist, having been enrolled at the University of South Florida in a music program before the move to St. Louis at age 11.

When he was twelve, Eric won the prestigious Scott Joplin piano competition in St. Louis, competing against college students. Son Paul was born soon before the move, and son Brian was born a year later in St. Louis.

### National Symposium Leadership
By now, the music studio in Sarasota, Florida had been sold, and Christine decided to stop private teaching. Instead, she concentrated on developing music education technology and began traveling the country giving presentations and master-level classes in music technology. She had already become the national specialist for MTNA, organizing and conducting the National Symposium on Technology in Music.

### Family Involvement in Technology Education
Packing up several electronic keyboards and the two youngest sons, Christine and Eric would drive the Dodge van from St. Louis to South Carolina, Texas, Florida, and other places teaching week-long professional development sessions. One memorable moment occurred when Christine was preparing for a presentation at a college. The acoustic pianos had been moved into the hall to make room for the electronic keyboards, and while Christine was speaking with several professors, little son Brian walked up to an acoustic piano and asked where the "On" switch was.

When one of Christine's commitments conflicted with a requested presentation at the Missouri State conference, young Eric, age 13, acted in her stead and presented music notation software technology to the session. He was a hit!

### Academic Pursuit and Innovation
After directing the MTNA Symposium for seventeen years, Christine passed the baton to others and concentrated on pursuing an idea that had been developing for several years. She wanted to create software to support music education that she could control and develop without computer programmer help, would be economical for the music teacher, would make effective use of technology, and could be kept current.

To pursue this, she decided to enroll at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville and earn a Masters of Science in Instructional Technology. As her final project, she created MusicLearningCommunity.com games using Adobe Flash. She graduated with a 4.0 GPA.

## The Birth of MusicLearningCommunity.com (2005-2011)

### Family Collaboration
Soon the whole family became involved in the new venture. Bill set up the limited liability company MusicLearningCommunity.com, LLC. Son Eric, now a college graduate in Business and Computer Science, created the back-end database and security. Paul, a budding graphic artist in high school, took photographs to be used as game backgrounds and created the mascot, Terry Treble. Brian, possessing a wonderfully attuned ear, acted as game tester (almost as close to his heart as playing video games).

Christine created a beta version of the website and asked several music teacher friends to test it with their students. The kids loved it! And they clearly were learning the concepts. At the next MTNA conference, Christine presented the concept to several of her long-term friends, who were very supportive of the effort.

### Commercial Launch and Immediate Success
At the 2006 MTNA national conference in Seattle, WA (coincidentally the home of Roger and Diane McRea of Temporal Acuity Products), the commercial website MusicLearningCommunity.com was introduced and was an immediate success. A number of teachers immediately signed up for subscriptions and many others signed up for free trials (50% of whom later became members). A large percentage of those first members were still members seven years later.

### Key Design Principles
Several concepts integral to the design proved extremely important:

1. **Cloud-based Presentation**: The website was effectively "in the cloud" years before that term became widely used, meaning music teachers didn't have to buy software to install on their computers and the product could be used anywhere internet access was available.

2. **Continuous Updates**: This also allowed for continuous updating without requiring any action by the client (teacher or student).

3. **Mastery-based Learning**: The games are designed to teach very specific concepts with a goal toward mastery of each concept. This method of delivering very small bites of information has been proven very effective.

4. **Quantitative Assessment**: To determine mastery, the games include automatic quantitative scoring, providing a specific measure of degree of mastery of a concept. When the student achieves the target score, their mastery of the concept is almost certain.

5. **Engaging Presentation**: The presentation of learning material as engaging games makes otherwise rote learning much more interesting to the student, encouraging persistence and reducing labor intensity for the teacher.

6. **Sustainable Business Model**: The use of a subscription model with a low price provides a continuing stream of income, supports continued product improvement and return on investment, forces maintenance of high quality and effectiveness, and permits use of electronic payment systems, reducing labor.

### Global Expansion and Unexpected Benefits
Over the next several years, the business continued to grow, more and more students were being served, and because this is internet technology, it spread worldwide. Very little advertising was done—teachers were referring other teachers to the learning games based on their successful experiences.

Reports came of an unexpected consequence. The simple and engaging game presentation turned out to be very supportive of the learning efforts of children with special needs, particularly those diagnosed as autistic. Not only did they enjoy playing the music games, noticeable improvement in other areas of their experience came as a result of that activity.

### Educational Institution Adoption
Some major universities had started using MusicLearningCommunity.com in afterschool programs and in conjunction with piano pedagogy classes. Public schools began using it as part of computer labs, using electronic whiteboards very successfully.

### Curriculum Alignment and Partnerships
The next major effort, other than continuing to add new games, was Christine's approach to supporting the various teaching methods teachers use, such as Alfred and Faber, as well as various state curricula. She set up individual student pages that correlated individual games to the sequencing of concepts presented by these external methods.

Yamaha Corporation approached MusicLearningCommunity.com to explore partnering with their Music In Education (MIE) program. As a result, a separate curriculum was created so that MusicLearningCommunity.com could be the "at home" component of the MIE program. This experiment demonstrated the value of being able to have game sequencing that matched external curricula.

### Major Milestone Achievement
A landmark was hit in 2011 when database reporting showed that over 60,000 students had been served in over 40 different countries. Although the website had been almost self-supporting, help calls did come in from time to time. When one Sunday morning around 3:00 am Christine received a call from a teacher whom she discovered in the conversation was calling from Hong Kong, she realized that she had achieved the level of success she was looking for. But this was not the end, just the first level of achievement.

## Family Growth and Continued Innovation (2011-2015)

### The Next Generation's Contributions
By this time, Eric had become an accomplished software developer and project manager, an occasional trombone player in the local symphony orchestra (he plays piano, organ, trombone and horn) and an in-demand church organist. Paul had graduated from Truman State University with a degree in trumpet performance. Among his achievements was winning the brass competition in the MTNA Missouri State contest, acting as a college sports photographer, teaching other college trumpet students (using MusicLearningCommunity.com), discovering he has a beautiful singing voice, and expanding his artistic and commercial graphic arts skills.

Brian, a saxophone player in high school, taught himself electric and acoustical guitar, started composing and recording, and then secured his certification in Pro Tools audio engineering software via an online course with Berklee Music School in Boston. Brian's wife, Zandrea, is a voice performance major and belongs to a musical family. As they worked together, Brian's two and a half octave singing voice was discovered. They have music careers ahead of them.

### The Need for Complete Redesign
The several years of experience with MusicLearningCommunity.com demonstrated its successes, but also revealed what else was needed to continue to keep its status as the premier product in the industry. What was needed was a complete redesign of the backend of the software to add desired functionality, and a facelift to the front end.

For the last years, Bill had been in a financial systems consulting occupation that involved extensive weekly travel. He was working with cities, counties, university foundations, and K-12 public schools across the nation. This was lucrative, but also made time at home limited and valuable. Just handling the accounting and other business aspects of running the MusicLearningCommunity.com LLC was all that he could do. But to update and revise the website was more than Christine could tackle alone.

### The Decision to Go Full-Time
So the first step was to engage a programmer to update the front end. This was the first time that outside help was engaged, other than the web-hosting services. The plan was to present a new look as soon as possible. But even while this was going on, a major family decision was made, and a long-suppressed vision was brought to the front.

Bill decided to quit his position and devote his efforts full-time to the family business, and to expand it to fulfill the vision developed when MusicLearningCommunity.com was started. To fulfill that, a young, innovative and progressive software firm in St. Louis, Spry Digital, was contracted to build a new website from the ground up, incorporating all the successful features already proven and new ones that had been on the "to do" list for years. All of the family, with their varied musical and technological talents, became enlisted in the effort.

## The Modern Era and Platform Evolution (2015-Present)

### New Foundation and Enhanced Functionality
An entirely new foundation structure was created that enables automatic assignments to students of any of many different named curriculum sequences. These assignments consist of video, text, and audio elements in addition to the games. Automatic achievement awards upon reaching goals are included. Custom teacher assignments are now possible. All-in-all, the labor required by the teacher was dramatically reduced while overall functionality was significantly improved.

Since much of the growth of MusicLearningCommunity.com is directly attributable to referrals by one teacher to another, a program providing rewards to referring teachers is included.

### Multi-Platform Community Development
From this effort came what is now presented as a full community of music education technology products and features and multiple websites for delivery:

- **MusicLearningCommunity.com**: Converted to a teacher resource center and primary source of information about music education technology
- **ComePlayMusic.com**: The music games were moved to this new website, with significant automation added, along with some new rhythm teaching technology
- **TerryTreble.com**: Created to provide various products to be used as incentives and awards for students
- **ComeSingMusic.com**: Currently under construction, it will specifically address the needs of voice students with new technology responsive to microphone input
- **PianoLessonsLive.com**: Currently under construction, it will provide adult-level piano teaching with remote live piano teachers

Additional internet domains have already been reserved for more websites to be added to the community and made available to all lovers of music.

### The Christine Hermanson Grant Program
In honor of the founder's dedication to music education, particularly early learners, the Christine Hermanson Grant Program was established. This program encourages early learners in music education by providing schools with free subscriptions to MusicLearningCommunity.com for General Music classes through a simple sponsor program.

Anyone who subscribes to the ENSEMBLE level (including a school) automatically becomes a sponsor for the school of their choice to provide a free SOLO subscription (of 5 seats) to be used for General Music. As long as the ENSEMBLE subscription is active, the free sponsored subscription remains active.

### Current Status and Future Vision
A labor of love, a successful commercial venture, and a significant contributor to support of music education throughout the world, a lot of effort has been expended, but the motto continues to be: **COME PLAY!**

The company continues to serve students worldwide, with the family's multi-generational involvement ensuring both continuity and innovation in music education technology.
