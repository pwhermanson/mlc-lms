# MusicLearningCommunity LMS â€” Executive Summary

## Purpose of this document

This is the master directive for the rebuild of MusicLearningCommunity (MLC). It provides the background, intent, scope, guiding principles, and success targets that will inform every specification and decision across the project.

## What MLC is

MLC is a learning platform that teaches music literacy with game-based, mastery-focused learning. Each Game covers a single concept, delivered as staged experiences: Learn, Play, Quiz, optional Challenge, and a distinct Review stage that records a separate score. Students can work through automated Sequences such as Lifetime Musician, Solfege, and Evaluation, or through method-aligned sequences that mirror popular books and curricula. The experience is accessible to students at home or school and is designed to reinforce teacher-led instruction.

---

## Why MLC exists

* To accelerate music literacy with measurable progress, making practice engaging while preserving pedagogical integrity.
* To reduce teacher workload through automation, reporting, and reusable sequences that map directly to common method books and state standards.
* To scale from single-teacher studios to large schools by supporting roles, bulk operations, and school billing needs.

---

## Heritage and context

* MLC has a long history of using technology for music education, with a structured specification library that includes detailed learning elements, screen designs, subscription plans, promo and sponsor code frameworks, and permissions models.
* Founded by Christine D. Morton Hermanson, a University of Michigan Music School graduate with K-12 teaching certification, MLC represents over 30 years of experience in music education technology innovation.
* Christine's journey from private music teaching to technology pioneer included partnerships with early music education software companies, 17 years directing the MTNA National Symposium on Technology in Music, and creating the original MLC games using Adobe Flash for her Master's thesis.
* The platform has served over 60,000 students across 40+ countries since 2006, with 50% of free trial users converting to paid subscriptions and many original members remaining active for 7+ years.
* Classic student flows emphasize assignments, badges, and a library of games; the modern rebuild keeps this DNA while updating UX, accessibility, and scale.
* Historical pricing and seat-scaling underscore the focus on serving schools at volume while remaining accessible to small studios.
* System admin feedback from prior versions highlighted the need for robust filtering, member structure visibility, and scalable user lists to support large institutions.
* The platform has proven particularly effective for students with special needs, including those on the autism spectrum, with noticeable improvements in learning outcomes beyond just music skills.

## Who MLC serves

* **Students** learn through short, concept-focused games and earn mastery via scores and badges. Students can be individual learners or part of group classes, with both regular students (with unique accounts and score tracking) and generic students (for group music classes sharing accounts).
* **Teachers** assign sequences aligned to their method, monitor progress, and communicate with students and parents. Teachers can play games for demonstration but scores are not recorded for teacher accounts.
* **Teacher-Admins** (Ensemble subscriptions) manage multiple teachers and students, assign students to specific teachers, view all student scores, and handle educational administration while being separate from billing responsibilities.
* **Subscriber-Admins** manage subscription, billing, seat allocation, payment information, and have full administrative capabilities. In Solo subscriptions, this role combines with Teacher capabilities.
* **System Admin** supports operations, visibility, and safe troubleshooting without requiring member passwords, with access to global user management and system-wide analytics.

## What MLC does at a functional level

1. **Game-based learning** with staged mastery and quantitative scoring, featuring Learn (tutor), Play (practice), Quiz (mastery assessment), Challenge (worldwide competition), and Review (retention testing) stages.
2. **Sequences** that automate delivery of Assignments and Review scheduling, including first-party libraries (Lifetime Musician, Solfege, Evaluation) and method-aligned sequences matching popular curricula like Alfred, Faber, RCM, and state standards.
3. **Discovery** via an All Games library filtered by concept, level, and skill area, covering aural and visual Pitch, Rhythm, Melody, Chords, Scales, Memory Playing, Intervals, Staff, Symbols, Keyboard Elements, Pattern Playing, and Musical Terms.
4. **Teacher tools** for assignment building, progress reports, class management, messaging, and automated sequence assignment to students.
5. **Admin tools** for mass operations, school hierarchies, billing, codes, CSV imports, and comprehensive member management.
6. **Pricing and seats** that support trials (Prelude: 19 slots, 30-day free), studios (Solo: 5-19 slots at $7.95/month + $0.80/additional), and large schools (Ensemble: 20+ slots at $19.95/month + $0.20/additional in sets of 5).
7. **MIDI integration** supporting both mouse and MIDI keyboard input via USB or Bluetooth for interactive keyboard games.
8. **Accessibility features** with proven effectiveness for students with special needs, including neurodiverse learners and those on the autism spectrum.

## Grand vision

A mastery-first, AI-enabled music learning platform that adapts to any teaching method, any classroom size, and any device. Teachers choose their preferred method; the platform maps those pages and objectives to the right Games, proposes sequences, and automates the rest. Students get the right practice at the right time. Schools get scale, visibility, and simple billing. System admins get reliability and safety.

---

## Strategic goals

1. **Learning outcomes**

   * Raise concept mastery rates and reduce time to mastery, evidenced by Quiz and Review scores across cohorts.
2. **Teacher efficiency**

   * Cut assignment prep and ongoing admin time through reusable sequences, bulk tools, and clear reports.
3. **Scalable operations**

   * Support thousands of students per school with fast lists, role-aware views, and robust filters.
4. **Adoption and retention**

   * Trial to paid conversion and seat growth through clear value for studios and schools, backed by tiered pricing.
5. **Accessibility and inclusion**

   * WCAG-compliant UX and options that have historically supported neurodiverse learners, with predictable layouts and reduced-stimulus modes.
6. **Trust and compliance**

   * Transparent data practices and school-friendly features such as POs, invoicing, and statements.

---

## Guiding principles

* **Mastery first**: Every feature should make it easier to teach, practice, assess, and retain concepts.
* **Sequence before search**: Default to guided Sequences, with All Games available for exploration and targeted assignments.
* **Scale by design**: Role hierarchy, bulk ops, and school billing are core, not add-ons.
* **Clarity and safety**: Admin visibility without insecure credential sharing; full auditability for support.
* **Data-driven decisions**: Track events, scores, time on task, and outcomes to inform product improvements.
* **Teacher-in-the-loop AI**: AI proposes; teachers approve and adjust.
