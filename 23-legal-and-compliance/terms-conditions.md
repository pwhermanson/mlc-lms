## 2. Subscription Plans and Pricing

### Available Subscription Plans

**PRELUDE (Free Trial)**: We offer a free trial PRELUDE subscription that provides potential members with full access to the learning management system and games so that suitability may be assessed prior to obtaining a paid subscription. The trial period is 30 days with up to 19 student seats available. No credit card is required for the trial.

**SOLO**: Our SOLO subscription plan is designed for individual music teachers and small studios. SOLO subscriptions may be paid monthly or annually. Monthly subscriptions start at $7.95/month for 5 student seats, with additional seats available at $0.80/month per seat.

**ENSEMBLE**: Our ENSEMBLE subscription plan is designed for schools, music programs, and organizations with multiple teachers. ENSEMBLE subscriptions may be paid monthly or annually.

## 3. Student Seats and Account Management

### Student Seats

Member subscribers have the ability to self-manage their accounts within our financial system area. Subscription pricing is based upon the plan selected and the number of student seats required.

**Student Seats Defined**: A student seat allows for individual student score tracking and progress monitoring. Students occupying seats may be made inactive, freeing the seats for use by other students. The inactive student's records are maintained, and, if a seat is available, the student may be re-activated.

### Adding or Reducing Student Seats

The number of student seats may be increased or decreased on monthly plans, and increased on annual plans, at any time.

**For Annual Plans**: The addition of student seats will be billed immediately, based upon proration to the end of the annual subscription period. The change in seats takes place immediately so that new students can be accommodated, and payment is expected to be made within 30 days. Annual plans do not allow seat reductions until the renewal date.

**For Monthly Plans**: The addition or reduction of student seats will be billed or credited, respectively, based upon proration to the end of the monthly billing period. On the following billing cycle, the amount charged to the credit card will be adjusted by the additional billing or credit, respectively.

### Self-Management

Subscribers can manage their subscription through the online account management system, including:
- Adding or removing student seats (subject to plan restrictions)
- Updating payment information
- Viewing billing history and statements
- Managing student and teacher accounts
- Pausing subscription (monthly plans only)
- Cancelling subscription

## 4. Cancellation, Refunds, and Pause Features

Membership subscriptions may be cancelled at any time through the self-management system. Your membership will remain active through the current billing cycle.

**Notice Requirements**: You can cancel your membership at any time by managing your subscription online or by emailing us at least one week before the end of your billing cycle.

### Automatic Renewal

**Annual Subscriptions**: Automatically renewed unless cancelled. No proration credits are provided upon cancellation.

**Unintended Renewal Refund**: If an unintended annual renewal takes place and a credit card is charged, we will refund the full charge upon notice to us within 30 days of the charge.

**Monthly Subscriptions**: Once initiated, will continue without termination until cancelled by the member.

### No Refunds Policy

### Reactivation After Cancellation

User credentials remain intact when a member cancels. If a member wishes to reactivate their subscription, they may log in and use the self-management system to re-subscribe to a plan the same or different from previous. Teachers and students will be automatically inactive, and may be re-activated according to the subscription's available student seats.
