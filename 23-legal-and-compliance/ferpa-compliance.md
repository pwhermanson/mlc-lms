## FERPA Regulatory Overview

### What is FERPA?

The **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)** is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Enacted in 1974 and codified at 20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g, FERPA applies to all schools and educational agencies that receive federal funding from the U.S. Department of Education.

**Key FERPA Provisions:**
- Grants parents/eligible students the right to inspect and review educational records
- Requires schools to obtain written consent before disclosing educational records (with specific exceptions)
- Allows parents/eligible students to request amendment of inaccurate or misleading records
- Requires schools to provide annual notification of FERPA rights

**Enforcement:**
- U.S. Department of Education, Family Policy Compliance Office (FPCO)
- Can withhold federal funding for non-compliance
- Does not provide private right of action (no individual lawsuits)

### When FERPA Applies

**FERPA Applies When:**
1. Institution receives funds under any program administered by the U.S. Department of Education, **AND**
2. Institution maintains education records on students

**Institutions Subject to FERPA:**
- Public elementary and secondary schools
- Private schools receiving federal education funding
- Public and private colleges and universities
- School districts and local educational agencies (LEAs)
- State educational agencies (SEAs)

**Institutions NOT Subject to FERPA:**
- Purely private schools receiving no federal education funds
- Homeschools in states where they're not considered schools
- Childcare centers not part of elementary school
- Religious institutions receiving no federal education funds

### MLC-LMS and FERPA Applicability

**MLC's Status:**
- MLC is a **service provider** to educational institutions
- MLC is **not directly subject to FERPA** (we do not receive federal education funding)
- However, when processing educational records on behalf of schools subject to FERPA, MLC must:
  - Act as a "school official" with legitimate educational interest
  - Comply with FERPA requirements as agent of the school
  - Maintain confidentiality and security of educational records
  - Not re-disclose records except as directed by the school
  - Return or destroy data when no longer needed for authorized purpose

**MLC's Commitment:**
- Even when serving non-FERPA institutions (private studios, international schools), we apply FERPA-level protections as best practice
- Our platform is designed to support FERPA compliance for all institutional subscribers

### FERPA vs. Other Privacy Laws

**FERPA Interaction with COPPA:**
- FERPA governs educational records at schools
- COPPA governs collection of personal information from children under 13
- Both can apply simultaneously (school with students under 13)
- See [COPPA/FERPA Notes](./coppa-ferpa-notes.md) for detailed interaction

**FERPA Interaction with GDPR:**
- FERPA applies to US schools with students' educational records
- GDPR applies to EU residents' personal data
- EU students at US schools: both FERPA and GDPR may apply
- See [GDPR Compliance](./gdpr-compliance.md) for EU-specific requirements

**FERPA Interaction with State Privacy Laws:**
- State laws may provide additional protections (California SOPIPA, New York Education Law 2-d)
- Strictest requirement applies when laws overlap
- MLC platform designed to support most stringent requirements

## Educational Records Under FERPA

### Definition of Educational Records

**FERPA Definition (20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g(a)(4)(A)):**

"Educational records" means records that are:
1. Directly related to a student, **AND**
2. Maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Student-specific**: Must relate to an identified or identifiable student
- **Maintained by school**: School or its agent (like MLC) maintains the record
- **Educational purpose**: Related to education, not just incidental presence at school

### Educational Records in MLC-LMS

The following data in MLC-LMS constitutes educational records under FERPA:

**Student Profile Information:**
- Student name (first and last)
- Username
- Email address (if provided)
- Date of birth (if collected)
- Class and group assignments
- Teacher assignments
- School/organization affiliation
- Account creation and modification dates

**Learning Performance Data:**
- Game scores and completion results
- Assignment completion status and grades
- Mastery level tracking
- Progress through curriculum sequences
- Time spent on educational activities
- Number of attempts and practice sessions
- Retention review performance
- Badge and achievement data

**Teacher Assessments:**
- Teacher-created custom assignments
- Teacher notes about student performance (if feature implemented)
- Teacher-assigned difficulty levels or placement
- Feedback provided to students
- Progress reports generated by teachers

**Communications:**
- Messages between teacher and student regarding educational matters
- Assignment instructions and clarifications
- Progress updates and notifications
- Parent communications about student performance

**Aggregate Data Tied to Individual Students:**
- Learning analytics showing individual student patterns
- Reports comparing individual student to class or cohort
- Predictive data about student performance or needs

### What is NOT an Educational Record

FERPA excludes certain types of records from the definition of "educational records":

**Sole Possession Records:**
- Personal notes made by teacher for their own use
- Not shared with others (except temporary substitute)
- Kept in sole possession of maker
- **MLC Consideration**: Teacher notes feature (if implemented) would NOT be sole possession if accessible to admins or stored centrally

**Law Enforcement Records:**
- Records created and maintained by school law enforcement unit
- Created for law enforcement purpose
- **MLC Status**: Not applicable (we don't process law enforcement records)

**Employment Records:**
- Records related to individual employed by school in capacity other than student
- **MLC Status**: Not applicable (no employment records)

**Medical and Treatment Records:**
- Records on students 18+ made by physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other professional
- Used only for treatment and not disclosed to others
- **MLC Status**: Not applicable (we don't process medical records)

**Alumni Records:**
- Records created after student no longer in attendance
- Do not relate to person as a student
- **MLC Consideration**: Data from active subscription retained 13 months after cancellation is still educational record during that period

**Directory Information (If Designated):**
- School may designate certain information as "directory information"
- Can include: name, address, phone, email, dates of attendance, awards
- Can be disclosed without consent IF parents given notice and opt-out opportunity
- **MLC Recommendation**: Do NOT treat student data as directory information

**Generic Student Accounts:**
- Shared accounts with no individual student identification
- No PII collected, aggregate scores only
- Not tied to individual students, therefore not "educational records"
- **MLC Implementation**: See [COPPA/FERPA Notes](./coppa-ferpa-notes.md) for Generic Student specifications

## Disclosure Logging and Records

### FERPA Requirement

Schools must maintain a record of each disclosure of PII from educational records (with limited exceptions).

**Required Information in Disclosure Log:**
- Name of party to whom disclosure was made
- Legitimate interest party had in the information
- Date of disclosure

**Exceptions (No Logging Required):**
- Disclosures to school officials with legitimate educational interest
- Disclosures pursuant to parent/eligible student consent (if consent specifies record will not be maintained)
- Directory information disclosures (if designated and notice provided)
- Disclosures to parent or eligible student themselves

### MLC-LMS Disclosure Tracking

**Automatic Logging:**
MLC automatically logs certain access to educational records:

**Logged Events:**

2. Work with MLC to retrieve disclosure log from platform
3. Explain entries in disclosure log to parent/student
4. Maintain disclosure logs for as long as records are maintained

---

## Homeschool Considerations

### FERPA Status of Homeschools

**FERPA Application:**
- FERPA applies to "educational agencies or institutions" receiving federal education funding
- Most homeschools do NOT receive federal funding
- Therefore, most homeschools are NOT subject to FERPA

**Exceptions:**
- Homeschools that are chartered or part of public school district (may receive federal funds)
- Homeschools in states where they're legally considered private schools receiving federal aid
- Homeschool cooperatives that receive federal education funding

**MLC Approach:**
- Even if homeschool is not subject to FERPA, MLC applies FERPA-level protections as best practice
- Homeschool subscribers benefit from same privacy safeguards as traditional schools
- Data Processing Agreement available for homeschool subscribers upon request

### Parent as Both "School" and "Parent"

**Unique Homeschool Context:**
- Parent acts as both the educational institution AND the parent
- Parent has both school's authority and parental rights
- Simplified data access (parent has full control)

**MLC Implementation for Homeschools:**
- Parent (subscriber-admin) has full access to all student data
- No separate parental consent process needed (parent is school official)
- Parental rights and school official rights merge
- Parent determines all uses of student data

**Privacy Protection Still Important:**

## Institutional Responsibilities

### School/Institution as Data Controller

**Primary Responsibilities:**
1. **Determine Purposes**: School decides how student data will be used
2. **Authorize MLC**: School designates MLC as school official
3. **Annual Notice**: School notifies parents of FERPA rights and MLC's access
4. **Respond to Requests**: School responds to parent/student access, amendment, consent requests
5. **Disclosure Decisions**: School determines when consent is required for disclosures
6. **Data Governance**: School maintains policies for educational records
7. **Training**: School trains staff on FERPA requirements
8. **Monitoring**: School monitors MLC's compliance with DPA and FERPA

### Subscriber-Admin Responsibilities

The Subscriber-Admin (school administrator using MLC platform) has specific operational duties:

**Data Management:**
- Create and manage student accounts in compliance with FERPA and COPPA
- Ensure parental consent obtained where required (students under 13)
- Configure appropriate access permissions for teachers
- Review and approve teacher requests for student data access
- Manage data retention and deletion requests

**Rights Fulfillment:**
- Respond to parent/eligible student requests for data access
- Generate data exports for parents using MLC tools
- Process amendment requests for inaccurate records
- Maintain disclosure logs accessible to parents
- Coordinate with MLC support for complex requests

**Compliance:**
- Include MLC in school's annual FERPA notice
- Ensure Data Processing Agreement is executed with MLC
- Monitor teachers' use of student data for educational purposes
- Report any suspected misuse of student data
- Coordinate with school's FERPA compliance officer

**Training:**
- Ensure teachers understand FERPA obligations
- Provide guidance on appropriate use of student data
- Clarify boundaries between educational use and impermissible uses
- Document training provided to staff

### Teacher Responsibilities

Teachers using MLC-LMS have FERPA obligations as school officials:

**Appropriate Use:**
- Access only data for students in their assigned classes
- Use student data only for legitimate educational purposes
- Do not share student data with unauthorized persons
- Do not use student data for personal purposes
- Maintain confidentiality of student educational records

**Security:**
- Secure login credentials (do not share accounts)
- Log out when leaving device unattended
- Do not access student records from unsecured public networks
- Report any suspected unauthorized access immediately

**Parental Communication:**
- Respond to parent questions about student progress
- Refer formal FERPA requests to subscriber-admin
- Understand limitations on disclosure without consent
- Document any disclosures made (for disclosure log)

**Technical Implementation:**
See [Permissions Table](../02-roles-and-permissions/permissions-table.md) for technical enforcement of teacher access restrictions.

## Higher Education vs. K-12 Differences

### Rights Transfer at Age 18

**K-12 (Under Age 18):**
- Parents have FERPA rights
- School communicates with parents about educational records
- Parents consent to disclosures
- Parents request access and amendment

**Age 18 or Postsecondary:**
- Rights transfer to student (now "eligible student")
- School communicates with student, not parent (unless exception applies)
- Student consents to disclosures
- Student requests access and amendment

**MLC Implementation:**
- Platform can flag students as "eligible students" based on age or education level
- Subscriber-admin configures whether rights belong to parent or student
- Access controls adjusted based on who has FERPA rights
- Communications directed appropriately

### Parental Access in Higher Education

**General Rule:**
Once student turns 18 or attends postsecondary institution, parents do NOT have automatic access to educational records.

**Exceptions:**
1. **Dependent Student Exception**: Higher ed institution MAY (but not required to) disclose to parents if student is dependent for tax purposes
2. **Health and Safety Emergency**: May disclose to parents if necessary to protect student's health or safety
3. **Student Consent**: Eligible student can provide written consent for parents to access records
4. **Violation of Law**: May disclose to parents if student under 21 violates law regarding alcohol or controlled substances

**MLC Higher Ed Implementation:**
- Student controls their own account and data access
- Parent access requires student's explicit consent
- Platform supports student consent workflow for parental access
- Higher ed institutions configure parent access policies in platform

---

## Multi-Institutional Data Sharing

### Student Transfers

**FERPA Allows Disclosure:**
Schools may disclose educational records without consent to officials of another school in which student seeks or intends to enroll.

**Requirements:**
- Reasonable attempt to notify parent/eligible student of disclosure
- Provide copy of records if requested
- Opportunity for hearing to challenge content (if requested)
- Exception: If annual notice states school forwards records on request

**MLC Implementation:**
- School can export student data to provide to new school
- Receiving school can import student data (if they also use MLC)
- Transfer logged in disclosure log
- See [Data Migration](../20-imports-and-automation/data-migration.md) for transfer procedures

### Multi-District or Consortia

**Shared Services:**
- Multiple schools may share single MLC institutional subscription
- Each school is a separate organization within MLC platform
- Data segregation by organization enforced by platform

**FERPA Considerations:**
- Each school is separate legal entity under FERPA
- School cannot access another school's students without authorization
- Consortium agreement should specify data sharing arrangements
- MLC enforces data isolation through access controls

**Technical Implementation:**
See [School Hierarchy View](../05-admin-subscriber-experience/school-hierarchy-view.md) for multi-school organizational structures.

## Open Questions

Outstanding decisions to be made before build:

### Educational Records Classification

**Scope Questions:**
- Are teacher-created custom assignments "sole possession records" (exempt) or educational records? **Decision needed**: Recommend treating as educational records if stored centrally
- Should platform usage analytics (time spent, pages visited) be classified as educational records? **Decision needed**: Recommend classifying as educational records when tied to individual students
- How do we handle student-to-student messages - are they educational records? **Decision needed**: Messages about educational content are records; social messages may not be

### Parental Access Implementation

**K-12 Parental Access:**
- Should parent accounts be separate feature or view-only access via teacher-provided codes? **Decision needed**: MVP could be view-only codes, Phase 2 adds parent accounts
- How do we verify parent identity before granting access? **Decision needed**: Rely on school's existing verification (parent contacts teacher/admin)
- What level of access do parents get - full dashboard or simplified view? **Decision needed**: Simplified view in MVP, full dashboard option in Phase 2

**Homeschool Context:**
- Do homeschool parents need separate parent accounts or is subscriber-admin access sufficient? **Decision needed**: Subscriber-admin access sufficient (parent IS the school)
- How do we verify homeschool parent identity (they are both school and parent)? **Decision needed**: Account holder verification sufficient

### Higher Education Implementation

**Rights Transfer:**
- How do we handle transition when student turns 18 mid-year? **Decision needed**: Manual flag toggle by subscriber-admin, automated birthday transition in Phase 2
- Should platform automatically transfer rights at age 18 or require manual configuration? **Decision needed**: Manual configuration in MVP (school determines policy)
- How do higher ed institutions configure parent access policies? **Decision needed**: Organization-level settings in subscriber-admin dashboard

**Dependent Student Exception:**
- Should platform support higher ed parent access under dependent student exception? **Decision needed**: Phase 2 feature, requires student consent workflow
- What consent mechanism is needed for eligible student to grant parents access? **Decision needed**: Consent form signed by student, logged in platform

### Amendment Requests

**Process Questions:**
- Who has final authority to approve/deny amendments - MLC or the school? **Decision**: School has final authority, MLC provides tools
- What is the process if parent disagrees with denial and requests hearing? **Decision**: School conducts hearing per their policy, MLC not involved
- Should technical errors (wrong score due to bug) be auto-corrected without formal amendment process? **Decision needed**: Yes, but with notification to school and logging

**Implementation Questions:**
- Should amendment requests be self-service or require admin intervention? **Decision needed**: Admin intervention in MVP, self-service portal in Phase 2
- How do we handle bulk amendment requests (e.g., wrong teacher assigned 30 students to wrong class)? **Decision needed**: Bulk correction tools for subscriber-admin, logged as single event

### Disclosure Logging

**Scope Questions:**
- Should teacher viewing student in their class be logged as disclosure? **Decision**: No - falls under school official exception
- Should every student dashboard view by student themselves be logged? **Decision**: No - not a disclosure (student accessing own records)
- Should parent viewing child's data be logged as disclosure (K-12)? **Decision**: No - parental access is not disclosure under FERPA
- Should exports for backup or migration purposes be logged? **Decision**: Yes - logged as internal disclosure for audit purposes

**Technical Questions:**
- How long should disclosure logs be retained? **Decision needed**: Recommend minimum 3 years, match record retention
- Should disclosure logs be accessible to parents/students on demand? **Decision**: Yes, via school administrator upon request

### Multi-Institutional Scenarios

**Transfers:**
- Should platform facilitate automated transfer of records between MLC-using schools? **Decision needed**: Phase 2 feature, requires school-to-school authorization workflow
- What consent is needed for transfer disclosures? **Decision**: None if covered in annual notice, otherwise reasonable attempt to notify

**Consortia:**
- Should multi-district consortia have shared or separate data? **Decision**: Separate by default with explicit data sharing agreements for any cross-district access
- Who is the "school" for FERPA purposes in a consortium? **Decision**: Each district is separate school, consortium agreement specifies roles

### Data Retention Edge Cases

**Graduation:**
- Should data be automatically deleted when student graduates? **Decision needed**: No - school determines retention, MLC retains per subscription status
- How long after graduation should schools retain educational records from MLC? **Decision**: School exports data for their own retention per state law, MLC follows subscription-based policy

**Student Withdrawal:**
- What happens to student data when student withdraws mid-year? **Decision needed**: Retained as part of school's records, school can delete individual student if needed
- Should withdrawn students be auto-deleted after X days? **Decision**: No automatic deletion, school decides

### Compliance Reporting

**Reports and Dashboards:**
- What metrics should be tracked in FERPA compliance dashboard? **Decision needed**: Access patterns, amendment requests, disclosure counts, rights requests
- Should schools have access to compliance dashboard for their organization? **Decision**: Yes, subscriber-admin dashboard includes FERPA compliance summary
- Who should receive automated compliance reports? **Decision needed**: System admin monthly, subscriber-admin optional enrollment
