# System Admin User Index

## Purpose
This specification enables system administrators to efficiently manage, search, and organize all users across the platform. It provides comprehensive user management capabilities including filtering, sorting, bulk operations, and detailed user profile access for support and administrative functions.

The user index serves as the central hub for system administrators to:
- Monitor user activity and account status across all organizations
- Provide technical support by accessing user profiles and credentials
- Manage user roles and permissions globally
- Track user registration patterns and system growth
- Perform bulk operations for user management
- Audit user actions and maintain compliance

## Scope

**Included:**
- Global user search and filtering capabilities
- User profile management and credential access
- Role-based user organization and sorting
- Bulk user operations and management
- User activity monitoring and audit trails
- Support access to user accounts and data
- User registration and deactivation management
- Cross-organization user analytics and reporting

**Excluded:**
- Organization-specific user management (see [Member Management](../05-admin-subscriber-experience/member-management.md))
- User role definitions and permissions (see [Roles Matrix](../02-roles-and-permissions/roles-matrix.md))
