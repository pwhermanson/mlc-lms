# System Admin Member Profile

## Purpose
This specification enables system administrators to access comprehensive member profile information for technical support, user management, and organizational oversight. It provides detailed user account data, credential access, organizational hierarchy viewing, and support context that is essential for effective platform administration and user assistance.

The member profile serves as the central interface for system administrators to:
- Access user credentials for technical support and troubleshooting
- View complete organizational structure and user hierarchy
- Monitor user activity and account status across all organizations
- Provide targeted support based on user context and history
- Manage user accounts and resolve access issues
- Audit user actions and maintain compliance records

## Scope

**Included:**
- Detailed user profile information and credentials
- Complete organizational hierarchy and user relationships
- User activity history and system interactions
- Support context including current assignments and progress
- Account status and subscription information
- User role and permission details
- Contact information and communication history
- Audit trail and compliance data

**Excluded:**
- Global user search and filtering (see [Sysadmin User Index](./sysadmin-user-index.md))
- Bulk user operations and management (see [Sysadmin User Index](./sysadmin-user-index.md))
