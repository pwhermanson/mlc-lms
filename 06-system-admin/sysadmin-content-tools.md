- Manage the complete content library including games, sequences, and learning elements
- Monitor content health, performance, and usage across the platform
- Perform bulk content operations and maintenance tasks
- Oversee content import/export processes and data migrations
- Audit content quality and ensure compliance with platform standards
- Manage content versioning, staging, and deployment workflows
- Provide technical support for content-related issues and user problems
