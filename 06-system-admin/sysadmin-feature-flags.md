# System Admin Feature Flags

## Purpose
This specification enables system administrators to comprehensively manage feature flags across the MLC platform, providing granular control over feature rollouts, A/B testing, emergency rollbacks, and gradual feature deployment.

- Controlled feature rollouts and gradual deployment strategies
- A/B testing and experimental feature management
- Emergency rollback capabilities for problematic features
- User segmentation and targeted feature delivery
- Platform stability and risk mitigation during releases
- Performance monitoring and feature impact analysis
- Compliance and regulatory feature controls
- Multi-environment feature synchronization
