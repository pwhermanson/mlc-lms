# Measures of Success

## Purpose

This specification defines the comprehensive framework for measuring success across the MusicLearningCommunity (MLC) platform rebuild. It establishes the key performance indicators (KPIs), metrics, and evaluation criteria that will be used to assess whether the platform is achieving its strategic goals outlined in the [product vision](../00-foundations/product-vision.md) and [executive summary](../00-foundations/executive-summary.md).

**What this enables:**
- Clear, measurable targets for product development across all phases
- Data-driven decision making for product iterations and resource allocation
- Alignment of technical implementation with business and learning objectives
- Accountability framework for stakeholders and development teams
- Evidence-based evaluation of platform effectiveness and ROI

**Why it exists:**
This document serves as the single source of truth for how we define, measure, and track success throughout the MLC rebuild and beyond. It connects strategic goals to quantifiable metrics, ensuring every feature and decision can be evaluated against its contribution to overall platform success.

## Data model (if applicable)

### Success Metrics Hierarchy

The MLC success measurement system is structured in four tiers:

#### Tier 1: Strategic Goals
High-level objectives that define overall platform success:
- **Learning Outcomes**: Accelerate music literacy with measurable mastery
- **Teacher Efficiency**: Reduce teacher workload and administrative overhead
- **Scalable Operations**: Support growth from studios to large schools
- **Adoption & Retention**: Convert trials to paid, grow seat counts, retain customers
- **Accessibility & Inclusion**: WCAG compliance and support for neurodiverse learners
- **Trust & Compliance**: Transparent data practices and school-friendly operations

#### Tier 2: Key Results
Measurable outcomes for each strategic goal:
- Each strategic goal maps to 3-5 key results
- Key results are quantifiable and time-bound
- Examples: "Raise Quiz mastery rate to 75%", "Cut assignment prep time by 60%"

#### Tier 3: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Specific metrics tracked continuously:
- Leading indicators (predict future success) and lagging indicators (measure past performance)
- Tracked at platform, organization, teacher, and student levels
- Examples: "Weekly active users", "Mastery rate by concept", "Trial-to-paid conversion %"

#### Tier 4: Operational Metrics
Granular data points that inform KPIs:
- Event-level tracking (see [event-model.md](../15-analytics-and-reporting/event-model.md))
- System performance metrics (see [observability.md](../19-quality-and-operations/observability.md))
- Examples: "Game session duration", "API response time", "Page load time"

## Behavior and rules

### Metric Calculation Standards

#### Time Windows
- **Real-time**: Events processed within 30 seconds of occurrence
- **Daily**: Aggregations calculated at midnight UTC
- **Weekly**: Sunday-Saturday windows, calculated Monday 2 AM UTC
- **Monthly**: Calendar month boundaries, calculated on 1st of following month
- **Rolling periods**: 7-day, 30-day, 90-day trailing windows updated daily

#### Baseline and Target Setting
- **Baseline**: Established from first 90 days of production data or historical MLC data where available
- **Target**: Expected performance level based on product goals and industry benchmarks
- **Stretch Goal**: Aspirational performance level representing exceptional outcomes
- **Minimum Viable**: Threshold below which intervention is required

#### Comparative Analysis Rules
- **Period-over-period**: Always compare equivalent time periods (same weekday patterns, academic calendar alignment)
- **Cohort analysis**: Group users by registration date or key milestones for accurate retention tracking
- **Seasonal adjustment**: Account for academic calendar, holidays, and summer break patterns
- **Statistical significance**: Minimum sample size of 30 for meaningful comparisons

### Data Quality and Validation

#### Event Collection Rules
- **Completeness**: All critical events must fire with required properties
- **Accuracy**: Scores, timestamps, and IDs validated before storage
- **Consistency**: Duplicate events deduplicated within 24-hour window
- **Privacy**: PII hashed or anonymized according to [privacy policy](../23-legal-and-compliance/privacy-policy.md)

#### Metric Validation Gates
- **Sanity checks**: Automated validation of metric values against expected ranges
- **Anomaly detection**: Flag unusual patterns (e.g., sudden 50% drops in engagement)
- **Data freshness**: Alert if metrics not updated within expected timeframe
- **Cross-validation**: Compare metrics from multiple data sources for consistency

### Success Evaluation Framework

#### Phase Success Criteria
Each development phase (see [phase-1-scope.md](./phase-1-scope.md), [phase-2-scope.md](./phase-2-scope.md), etc.) defines specific success criteria that must be met before proceeding to the next phase:

**Phase 1 (Foundation) Success:**
- ✅ User registration, login, and session management fully functional
- ✅ All unit and integration tests passing
- ✅ No critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Documentation complete and deployment automated

**Phase 2+ Success:**
- Each phase builds on previous success criteria
- Must maintain all previous phase metrics while adding new capabilities
- Cannot regress on existing KPIs to ship new features

#### Continuous Improvement Cycle
1. **Measure**: Collect data across all metric categories
2. **Analyze**: Compare actuals vs. targets, identify trends and patterns
3. **Diagnose**: Investigate gaps and underperformance areas
4. **Act**: Implement improvements, run experiments, iterate features
5. **Validate**: Confirm improvements through data, repeat cycle

- Particularly effective for special needs learners, including autism spectrum

**Business model:**
- Tiered pricing (Prelude, Solo, Ensemble) successfully scaled from studios to schools
- Seat-based pricing model aligned costs with value delivered
- Teachers charging students $1-2/month demonstrated strong ROI perception

**Limitations of historical data:**
- Limited systematic data collection (pre-analytics era)

- **Target**: Align with top-quartile EdTech performance benchmarks
- **Stretch**: Achieve best-in-class metrics that differentiate MLC

**Continuous improvement:**
- Phase 1: Establish measurement infrastructure
- Phase 2: Collect baseline data from first production users
- Phase 3+: Iteratively optimize toward targets based on real data

**Evidence-based adjustment:**
- Review targets quarterly against actual performance
- Adjust based on market conditions, competitive landscape, user feedback
- Never lower standards for quality, security, or learning efficacy
