## Behavior and Rules

### Impersonation Authorization

#### System Admin Requirements
- **Role Restriction**: Only System Admin role can perform impersonation
- **MFA Required**: Multi-factor authentication required before impersonation
- **Justification Required**: Must provide valid support reason for impersonation
- **Time Limits**: Impersonation sessions limited to 2 hours maximum
- **Concurrent Limits**: Maximum 3 concurrent impersonation sessions per System Admin
- **Approval Workflow**: High-risk impersonations may require additional approval

#### Target User Restrictions
- **Active Users Only**: Can only impersonate active, non-locked users
- **Organization Scope**: Can impersonate users from any organization
- **Role Limitations**: Cannot impersonate other System Admin users
- **Consent Notification**: Users must be notified of impersonation activity
- **Data Sensitivity**: Special handling for student data (COPPA compliance)

### Impersonation Process

#### Initiation
1. **Support Request**: User contacts support or System Admin identifies need
2. **Authentication**: System Admin authenticates with MFA
3. **User Selection**: System Admin selects target user to impersonate
4. **Reason Entry**: System Admin provides detailed reason for impersonation
5. **Risk Assessment**: System evaluates risk level and applies restrictions
6. **Session Creation**: Impersonation session created with appropriate scope
7. **User Notification**: Target user notified of impersonation activity

#### During Impersonation
- **Session Isolation**: Impersonation session isolated from System Admin's normal session
- **Action Logging**: All actions performed logged in real-time
- **Data Access Tracking**: All data accessed recorded for audit purposes
- **Time Monitoring**: Session automatically expires after 2 hours
- **Activity Validation**: Actions validated against user's normal permissions
- **Emergency Termination**: Session can be terminated immediately if needed

#### Termination
- **Automatic Expiry**: Session expires after 2 hours of inactivity
- **Manual Termination**: System Admin can end session manually
- **Emergency Stop**: Session terminated if suspicious activity detected
- **User Notification**: Target user notified when impersonation ends
- **Audit Summary**: Complete audit log generated for the session
