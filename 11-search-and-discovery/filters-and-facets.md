# Filters and Facets

This document defines the comprehensive filtering and faceted navigation system for the MLC learning management system, enabling users to efficiently discover and select appropriate music learning games through multiple classification dimensions.

## Purpose

The filters and facets system enables users to narrow down the extensive library of 450+ music learning games through multiple classification dimensions, supporting both guided discovery and targeted search. This system is essential for teachers creating assignments, students finding appropriate practice material, and administrators managing content across different skill levels and musical concepts.

The system addresses the core challenge of content discovery in a rich educational environment where games span multiple musical concepts, difficulty levels, and learning approaches. By providing intuitive filtering mechanisms, users can quickly find games that match their specific pedagogical needs, student skill levels, and curriculum requirements.

## Scope

**Included:**
- Multi-dimensional filtering system (level, skill area, concept, difficulty, learning mode)
- Faceted navigation with hierarchical category browsing
- Real-time filter application with instant result updates
- Filter persistence across user sessions
- Advanced search combinations with multiple active filters
- Filter state management and clear/reset functionality
- Responsive filter interfaces for different device types
- Integration with search indexing and content taxonomy

**Excluded:**
- Search query processing and text matching (covered in [search-indexing.md](search-indexing.md))

```

## Behavior and rules

### Filter Application Rules

1. **Multi-dimensional Filtering**: Users can apply multiple filters simultaneously across different dimensions
2. **Hierarchical Filtering**: Filters within the same category use OR logic; filters across categories use AND logic
3. **Real-time Updates**: Filter changes immediately update search results without page refresh
4. **Filter Persistence**: Active filters persist across user sessions and page navigation
5. **Filter Validation**: System validates filter combinations to ensure meaningful results

### Facet Display Rules

1. **Dynamic Facet Population**: Facet options update based on current filter state and available content
2. **Count Display**: Each facet option shows the number of matching results
3. **Zero Count Handling**: Facet options with zero results are hidden or disabled
4. **Hierarchical Navigation**: Parent categories can be expanded to show subcategories
5. **Selection Limits**: Some facets may have maximum selection limits to prevent overly broad queries

### Filter State Management

1. **Filter History**: System maintains history of filter changes for undo functionality
2. **Bulk Operations**: Users can clear all filters or reset to default state
3. **Filter Sharing**: Filter states can be saved and shared between users
4. **Smart Defaults**: System suggests appropriate default filters based on user role and context
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced filters are hidden by default but accessible on demand

### Content Availability Rules

1. **Permission-based Filtering**: Only show content accessible to user's subscription level
2. **Level Appropriateness**: Weight results based on user's current learning level
3. **Sequence Context**: Show games in context of assigned learning sequences
4. **Language Preferences**: Respect user's language selection (English vs. Solfege)
