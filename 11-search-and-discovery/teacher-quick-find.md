# Teacher Quick Find

This document defines the quick find functionality that enables teachers to rapidly discover and select music learning games for assignment creation, student practice, and curriculum planning.

## Purpose

The Teacher Quick Find system provides educators with instant access to the most relevant music learning games from the library of 450+ games, optimized for the specific workflow of creating assignments and finding appropriate content for students.

## Behavior and rules

### Search Behavior
1. **Intelligent Auto-complete**: Provides real-time suggestions as teachers type, prioritizing:
   - Game names and concepts
   - Skill areas and musical terms
   - Recently used search terms
   - Popular searches from other teachers

2. **Contextual Ranking**: Search results are ranked based on:
   - Exact text matches in game names and descriptions
   - Skill area relevance to search terms
   - Level appropriateness for target students
   - Teacher's usage history and preferences
   - Game popularity and effectiveness metrics

3. **Smart Suggestions**: System suggests related games and concepts:
   - "Games like this" recommendations
   - Prerequisite and follow-up games
   - Alternative difficulty levels
   - Complementary skill areas

### Filter Application Rules
1. **Multi-dimensional Filtering**: Teachers can combine multiple filters:
   - Level filters use OR logic (Level 1 OR Level 2)

   - Advanced filters support complex combinations

2. **Filter Persistence**: Active filters persist across:
   - Search query changes
   - Page navigation within results
   - User sessions (with opt-in)

3. **Dynamic Filter Updates**: Filter options update based on:

   - Available content for user's subscription
   - Student level context

### Quick Access Features
