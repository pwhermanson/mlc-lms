## Future Vision: Discussion Forums and Collaborative Spaces

### Phased Approach to Community Discussions

While MLC's current social features focus on teacher-mediated communication and passive peer modeling, future phases will introduce structured, teacher-moderated discussion forums and collaborative learning spaces.

### Phase 2: Class Discussion Boards (Future)

#### Structure and Purpose

**Teacher-Initiated Topic Discussions**
- Teacher creates discussion topics related to musical concepts (e.g., "What strategies help you remember interval names?")
- Students post responses and replies
- Teacher moderates all posts before they go live
- Focus on musical learning and concept discussion, not general socializing

#### Safety and Moderation Model

**Pre-Publication Moderation**
- All student posts held in moderation queue
- Teacher reviews and approves before post appears to class
- Teacher can edit student post for clarity or appropriateness (with notification to student)
- Teacher can provide feedback on post before approval

**Discussion Guidelines**
- Clear expectations for constructive, learning-focused contributions
- "Helpful response" reputation system (students earn points for quality contributions)
- No off-topic discussion or personal conversation
- All posts logged and visible to administrators

#### Pedagogical Benefits

- Collaborative assignment completion (e.g., group composition or arrangement)

#### Collaborative Learning Activities

**Potential Group Assignments**
- Collaborative composition project (each student contributes measures)
- Group challenge competition (combined scores)
- Peer teaching assignments (advanced students mentor newer students with teacher supervision)
- Musical analysis discussion (group analyzes a musical piece together)

#### Safety and Privacy

- All groups formed by teacher (no student-initiated groups)
- Teacher visibility into all group communication
- Guardian notification of group participation
- Option to remove student from group if concerns arise
- Groups dissolved at end of project or term

### Phase 4: Global Community Features (Future)

#### Considerations for Broader Community

- **[A11y Standards](../01-ux-design-system/a11y-standards.md)**: Accessibility requirements for all community interfaces
- **[Localization](../01-ux-design-system/localization-internationalization.md)**: Multi-language support for global community features
- **COPPA Compliance**: Guardian consent and privacy protections for students under 13 participating in community features
- **Content Moderation Standards**: Platform-wide policies for appropriate content in profiles, feeds, and discussions

## Open Questions

### Community Structure and Pedagogy
- **Optimal Class Size**: What class size maximizes community engagement without overwhelming feed activity or teacher moderation burden?
- **Multi-Class Membership**: How should student experience differ when belonging to multiple classes? Single unified feed or separate feeds?
- **Achievement Feed Efficacy**: Does achievement feed increase motivation and engagement, or does it create unproductive comparison and anxiety? How do we measure and optimize?
- **Community Identity**: What features beyond shared class dashboard create strongest sense of class identity and belonging?

### Privacy and Safety
- **Guardian Involvement**: What level of guardian visibility into student community activity is appropriate for different age groups?
- **Public vs. Class-Only Profiles**: Should there be different levels of public profile visibility (e.g., fully public, class-only, teacher-only, private)?
- **Moderation Scalability**: At what community size do we need professional moderator team vs. relying on teacher moderation?
- **Student Reporting**: How can we encourage students to report concerning content without creating false reports or anxiety?

### Future Features - Discussion Forums
- **Pre-Moderation Feasibility**: Is pre-publication moderation (all posts reviewed before appearing) scalable for active discussions? Or do we need post-publication moderation with rapid teacher response?
- **Discussion Value**: What evidence do we need to demonstrate that structured discussions enhance musical learning before investing in forum features?
- **Off-Topic Discussion**: Should there be any space for non-musical social conversation (e.g., "introduce yourself" threads)? Or strictly learning-focused only?

### Future Features - Collaborative Groups
- **Group Formation**: Should students ever have input into group formation, or always teacher-assigned?
- **Collaborative Assessment**: How do we fairly assess collaborative work when students contribute differently?
- **Synchronous Collaboration**: What infrastructure is needed to support real-time collaborative music activities (e.g., simultaneous composition, group rhythm games)?

### Technical Implementation
- **Feed Algorithm**: Should achievement feed use chronological order, or some form of relevance/popularity ranking? If ranking, what factors?
- **Profile Caching**: What caching strategy balances profile freshness with performance at scale?
- **Real-Time Updates**: Do achievement feeds need real-time updates, or is periodic refresh (e.g., every 60 seconds) sufficient?
- **Moderation Tooling**: What third-party content moderation tools/services should we integrate vs. building in-house?

### International and Cultural Considerations
- **Cultural Norms**: How should community features adapt to different cultural norms around competition, public recognition, and peer interaction?
- **Global vs. Regional Communities**: Should there be region-specific communities (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia) in addition to class-based communities?
- **Language in Global Features**: If students from different language backgrounds interact (e.g., global challenge boards), what language support is needed?
