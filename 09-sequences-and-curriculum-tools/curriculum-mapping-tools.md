# Curriculum Mapping Tools

## Overview
Tools and utilities for mapping MLC content to external curriculum standards and teaching methods.

## Description
Comprehensive system for aligning learning sequences with various piano methods, state standards, and educational frameworks, enabling teachers to find relevant content for their specific curriculum needs.

## Purpose
This document defines the **tooling ecosystem** used by Content Editors and System Administrators to create, validate, maintain, and analyze curriculum mappings between MLC's game library and external educational frameworks. These tools support the data structures defined in [Sequence Model](sequence-model.md) and the alignment processes described in [Sequence Alignment to Methods](sequence-alignment-to-methods.md).

- **Import/Export Utilities**: Bulk data operations for curriculum content
- **Validation Tools**: Automated checks for mapping completeness and accuracy
- **Gap Analysis Tools**: Identifying unmapped concepts and missing content
- **Correlation Maintenance**: Tools for updating mappings when editions or standards change
- **Standards Database Integration**: Cross-reference to MENC, state standards, and international frameworks
- **Visualization Tools**: Graphical representation of curriculum coverage
- **Health Monitoring**: Tools for tracking mapping quality and usage
- **Batch Operations**: Bulk updates across multiple curriculum mappings

### Excluded
- **Sequence data model details** (see [Sequence Model](sequence-model.md))

## Key Concepts

### Curriculum Mapping Workflow
The curriculum mapping process follows these stages:
1. **Content Analysis**: Review external curriculum structure and concepts
2. **Concept Identification**: Tag concepts using MLC's taxonomy system
3. **Game Mapping**: Link MLC games to curriculum concepts
4. **Validation**: Verify completeness and accuracy
5. **Publication**: Make mapping available for teacher use
6. **Maintenance**: Update mappings as curricula evolve

### Mapping Targets
MLC supports mapping to multiple external frameworks:
- **Method Books**: Piano Adventures, Hal Leonard, Alfred's, etc.
- **National Standards**: MENC/NAfME National Music Standards
- **State Standards**: California MTAC, Texas MTA, Florida MTA, etc.
- **International Frameworks**: Royal Conservatory, ABRSM, Trinity College
- **Custom Curricula**: School-specific or organization-level curricula

## Core Tools and Utilities

### 1. Curriculum Mapping Authoring Interface

The mapping authoring interface provides Content Editors with a specialized workspace for creating and editing curriculum alignments.

#### Features
- **Dual-pane editor**: External curriculum structure on the left, MLC game library on the right
- **Drag-and-drop mapping**: Drag games onto curriculum concepts to create associations
- **Metadata editor**: Rich forms for entering page correlations, concept tags, and skill statements
- **Preview mode**: Real-time preview of how mapping will appear to teachers and students
- **Version control**: Track changes and maintain history of mapping edits
- **Collaboration**: Multi-editor support with conflict resolution

#### Workflow
1. **Import curriculum structure**: Load external curriculum outline (manual entry or CSV import)
2. **Define levels and units**: Create hierarchical structure matching the curriculum
3. **Tag concepts**: Apply MLC's concept taxonomy to each curriculum element
4. **Map games**: Link appropriate games to each concept
5. **Set targets**: Define target scores and gating rules per game stage
6. **Validate**: Run validation checks before publishing
7. **Publish**: Make mapping available in sequence library

#### Access Control
- **Content-Editor role** required for creating and editing mappings
- **Org-scoped permissions** for custom curricula
- **Audit logging** of all changes with user attribution

### 2. CSV Import/Export Tools

Bulk operations for curriculum data enable efficient creation and maintenance of large-scale mappings, particularly for method books with extensive content libraries.

#### Import Capabilities
**Supported formats**:
- **Curriculum outline CSV**: Levels, units, pages, concepts
- **Game mapping CSV**: Game IDs, stages, targets, page correlations
- **Standards alignment CSV**: Standards codes, concept mappings
- **Historical data**: Import from legacy MLC-4.0 formats

**Import workflow**:
1. **Upload CSV file**: System validates column headers and data types
2. **Preview**: Show mapping preview with validation warnings
3. **Conflict resolution**: Handle duplicates, missing games, invalid concept tags
4. **Bulk import**: Create or update sequence data
5. **Post-import validation**: Automated health check on imported content

**CSV schema for curriculum structure**:
```csv
sequence_code,level,unit_number,page_range,lesson_title,concepts,game_id,stage,target_score,notes
FABR,Primer,1,4-11,Middle C Position,"keyboard_geography,hand_position",G-01542,learn,N/A,Introduction to keyboard

### 3. Validation and Quality Assurance Tools

Automated validation ensures mapping completeness, accuracy, and consistency across the curriculum library.

#### Validation Categories

**Critical Errors** (prevent publishing):

- **Duplicate IDs**: Collision in group, assignment, or step identifiers

**Warnings** (allow publishing with acknowledgment):
- **Deprecated games**: Games marked for sunset or replacement
- **Incomplete page correlations**: Missing page ranges or lesson titles
- **Concept coverage gaps**: Curriculum concepts lacking MLC game coverage
- **Target score outliers**: Scores significantly different from game baselines
- **Stale correlation dates**: Mappings not reviewed in 3+ years

**Advisory Notices** (informational):

### 4. Gap Analysis Tools

Gap analysis identifies where external curricula introduce concepts that MLC's game library doesn't adequately cover, informing game development priorities.

#### Gap Detection

**Concept Coverage Matrix**:

- Visualize coverage density by concept area
- Identify "orphaned" curriculum concepts with zero game mappings
- Track coverage improvements over time

**Method-specific gap reports**:
- Piano Adventures: Which levels/pages lack adequate game coverage
- Hal Leonard: Concepts taught but not reinforced by MLC games
- State standards: Standards with insufficient supporting content
- International frameworks: Royal Conservatory topics needing development

#### Gap Analysis Dashboard

**Coverage Heatmap**:
```
Concept Area          | Primer | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3
---------------------|--------|---------|---------|--------
Keyboard Elements    | 98%    | 95%     | 92%     | 88%
Staff Reading        | 100%   | 98%     | 95%     | 90%
Rhythm & Meter       | 85%    | 88%     | 80%     | 75%  ‚Üê Gap!
Intervals            | 90%    | 92%     | 95%     | 98%
Scales               | 95%    | 98%     | 95%     | 88%
```

**Gap Prioritization**:
- **High priority**: Foundational concepts with < 70% coverage
- **Medium priority**: Advanced concepts with < 85% coverage
- **Low priority**: Specialized concepts with 85%+ coverage
