## Purpose and Scope

### What This Document Covers
This document provides visual branding, legal usage rights, and brand identity guidelines specifically for the Terry Treble character. It defines how the mascot should be represented visually across all marketing materials, product interfaces, and promotional contexts.

### What This Document Does NOT Cover
For Terry Treble's **voice, personality, and copywriting usage** in student-facing content, see **[Copy Guide Students](./copy-guide-students.md)** which details when and how to use Terry's character voice in educational contexts, tutorials, and student messaging.

## Character Origin and History

### Creation and Family Legacy
Terry Treble was created by **Paul Hermanson** during the initial development of MusicLearningCommunity.com circa 2005-2006, when Paul was a high school student and budding graphic artist. As documented in [Company History](../00-foundations/company-history.md), Paul's contributions also included background photographs and other game characters as part of the family's collaborative effort to build the platform.

The character emerged from the Hermanson family's vision of creating an engaging, non-threatening learning environment where "students think they are playing, but you know they're learning." Terry Treble embodies this philosophy as a friendly guide who makes music theory accessible and fun.

### Character Purpose in Platform Ecosystem

### TerryTreble.com Product Line
As part of the MLC multi-platform community, **TerryTreble.com** was established to provide physical products, incentives, and awards featuring the character for student motivation and recognition. This extends the character's presence beyond the digital platform into tangible rewards that reinforce engagement.
