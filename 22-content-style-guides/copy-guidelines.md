## Core Mission and Educational Philosophy

### The Lifetime Musician Goal

All MLC copy should reinforce the platform's fundamental mission: **transforming students into Lifetime Musicians** who can read, write, think, and create in the universal language of music, continuing to learn new music independently for a lifetime of enjoyment.

*Source: MLC Site Content, 2020*

**Key Principles:**
- Music literacy is the foundation of lifelong musical engagement
- Learning happens through multimedia games, not passive study
- Students work independently at their own pace
- Professional music teacher guidance is the cornerstone of success
- Technology is a "tireless teaching assistant," not a replacement for teachers
- Success and mastery are the best motivators

### Core Value Propositions by Audience

**For Students:**
> "Students think they are playing, but you know they're learning."

Games are engaging and non-threatening, teaching essential music concepts step-by-step without feeling like homework or studying.

**For Teachers:**
> "Your tireless teaching assistant with hundreds of online games that reinforce essential theory and aural skills."

The platform extends teaching reach, provides quantitative assessment, and correlates with popular piano methods while respecting professional expertise.

**For Parents/Schools:**
> "Teachers report that after one year of playing the learning games, their students are 3 to 5 months ahead of where they were before."

Measurable progress, aligned with standards, promoting differentiated learning from beginning through intermediate levels.

## Platform Voice and Tone

### Platform Voice (Consistent Across All Contexts)

The MLC platform voice is:

#### 1. **Educational and Pedagogically Sound**
- Rooted in solid music education principles developed by Christine Hermanson, nationally-recognized pioneer in music education technology
- Respects comprehensive music curriculum that trains the eye, ear, and fingers
- References proven methodologies and alignment with state/national standards
- Uses accurate musical terminology appropriate to the user's level

#### 2. **Supportive and Confidence-Building**
- Encourages consistent practice and growth mindset
- Celebrates achievement without shame or excessive pressure
- Frames challenges as opportunities for mastery
- Acknowledges effort and progress, not just perfection

#### 3. **Clear and Accessible**
- Uses plain language over jargon (except where music terminology is educational)
- Provides immediate feedback and actionable guidance
- Organizes information in scannable, hierarchical formats
- Prioritizes clarity and efficiency over cleverness

#### 4. **Professional Yet Approachable**
- Maintains credibility with educators and institutions
- Friendly without being juvenile or patronizing
- Honest about capabilities, limitations, and pricing
- Transparent about data usage, billing, and expectations

#### 5. **Inclusive and Respectful**
- Acknowledges diverse learning styles and needs
- Proven success with special needs students
- Supports multiple teaching methods and instruments (not piano-only)
- Welcomes learners of all ages and backgrounds

*Reference: [Pedagogy Principles](../00-foundations/pedagogy-principles.md), [Neurodiverse Support](../16-accessibility-and-inclusion/neurodiverse-support.md)*

### Tone Adaptation by Role and Context

While the core **voice** remains consistent, **tone** adapts based on the user's role, emotional state, and context:

| **Context** | **Tone Characteristics** | **Example** |
|-------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Student - Success** | Enthusiastic, celebratory, encouraging | "Amazing! You've mastered rhythm reading! Ready for your next challenge?" |
| **Student - Struggle** | Patient, reassuring, non-judgmental | "Not quite yet—let's try the Learn stage again to review the concept." |
| **Teacher - Workflow** | Efficient, professional, action-oriented | "Create assignment • Select students • Choose sequence • Assign" |
| **Teacher - Reporting** | Data-focused, analytical, pedagogically framed | "5 students below target score on Intervals Level 2 Quiz" |
| **Admin - Billing** | Transparent, business-focused, precise | "Next billing: March 15, 2025 • $45.00 • 23 of 25 seats used" |
| **Admin - Alerts** | Direct, honest, solution-oriented | "Payment failed: Update credit card to avoid service interruption" |
| **Error - Critical** | Calm, apologetic, directive | "We couldn't load your game. Refresh the page or contact support." |
| **Error - Validation** | Instructive, neutral, helpful | "Username must be 3-15 characters with no spaces." |

*Reference: Role-specific copy guides for detailed tone guidance*

---

## Universal Writing Principles

### 1. Lead With Action and Value

**Principle**: Start with what the user can do or what value they'll receive, not with system functions or technical details.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Create your first assignment in 3 clicks"
- ❌ "The assignment creation system is available"
- ✅ "Monitor student progress with automatic score reports"
- ❌ "Score reporting functionality has been implemented"

### 2. Use Concrete, Specific Language

**Principle**: Avoid vague or abstract terms. Be precise about actions, outcomes, and expectations.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Add 10 students"
- ❌ "Manage users"
- ✅ "Your subscription renews March 15 for $45"
- ❌ "Your subscription will renew soon"
- ✅ "Complete 5 more games to earn the Rhythm Master badge"
- ❌ "You're making great progress!"

### 3. Respect User Time and Cognitive Load

**Principle**: Write concisely. Front-load the most important information. Break complex information into scannable chunks.

**Formatting Techniques:**
- Use headings and subheadings to create visual hierarchy
- Write short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max in UI contexts)
- Use bullet lists for related items
- Bold key terms and actions
- Provide summaries before detailed explanations

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Next: Assign sequence • Select 'Lifetime Musician' from dropdown"
- ❌ "Now that you've created your students, you'll want to assign them a learning sequence. The system offers several sequence options, including our default 'Lifetime Musician' sequence, which you can select from the dropdown menu in the assignment interface."

### 4. Match Vocabulary to User Expertise

**Principle**: Use age-appropriate and role-appropriate terminology. Introduce music terms progressively for students; use professional terminology with teachers.

**Examples (Students):**
- ✅ Ages 6-9: "High notes" → Ages 10-12: "Higher pitch" → Ages 13+: "Ascending intervals"
- ✅ Ages 6-8: "Play the keys" → Ages 9+: "Play the keyboard"
- ✅ All ages: "Game" (not "lesson" or "drill")

**Examples (Teachers):**
- ✅ "Align with Piano Adventures Level 2A"
- ✅ "Monitor mastery through Quiz target scores"
- ✅ "Assign retention review games"

**Examples (Admins):**
- ✅ "Prorated billing adjustment"
- ✅ "Annual vs. monthly subscription comparison"
- ✅ "Seat utilization: 47 of 50 active"

*Reference: [Glossary](../00-foundations/glossary.md) for platform terminology definitions*

### 5. Frame Challenges as Opportunities

**Principle**: Avoid negative framing. Position difficulties as normal parts of the learning process and pathways to mastery.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Not quite yet—let's review this concept and try again"
- ❌ "Incorrect. You failed this quiz."
- ✅ "You're 2 games away from completing Level 3!"
- ❌ "You haven't finished Level 3 yet."
- ✅ "This game helps you master rhythm reading"
- ❌ "This game tests whether you know rhythm reading"

### 6. Provide Context and Rationale

**Principle**: Explain the "why" behind actions, especially for teachers and admins making pedagogical or business decisions.

**Examples (Teachers):**
- ✅ "Assign the Evaluation sequence to new students to assess their proficiency and identify areas for improvement."
- ❌ "Assign Evaluation sequence."

**Examples (Admins):**
- ✅ "Annual subscriptions save 17% vs. monthly billing but require upfront payment and don't allow seat reductions."
- ❌ "Annual subscriptions available."

### 7. Use Parallel Structure and Consistency

**Principle**: Within a list or set of related items, maintain consistent grammatical structure, verb tense, and formatting.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Create students • Assign sequences • Monitor progress"
- ❌ "Create students • Sequences can be assigned • You should monitor progress"
- ✅ "Dashboard / Assignments / Scores / Settings"
- ❌ "Dashboard / Your Assignments / View Scores / Settings Panel"

## Terminology and Vocabulary Standards

### Core Educational Terms

| **Preferred Term** | **Avoid** | **Context** |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Game** | Lesson, drill, exercise, activity | Students always see "games" to maintain "playing not studying" perception |
| **Stage** | Level, phase, step (within a game) | Games have stages: Learn, Play, Quiz, Challenge, Review |
| **Assignment** | Homework, task, requirement | What teachers create for students to complete |
| **Sequence** | Curriculum, course, playlist | Ordered progression of games and learning elements |
| **Lifetime Musician** | Master musician, expert, professional | Our aspirational goal; capital L and M |
| **Target Score** | Passing score, minimum score, goal | Score indicating mastery on Quiz stage |
| **Mastery** | Completion, passing, success | Achieving target score demonstrates concept mastery |
| **Retention Review** | Spaced repetition, review quiz | Games presented at intervals to ensure concept retention |

*Reference: [Glossary](../00-foundations/glossary.md) for complete platform terminology*

### Game Stage Terminology

All games follow a consistent stage structure. Always use these exact terms:

1. **Learn** (Tutorial) - Introduces the concept with guidance
2. **Play** (Practice) - Student practices the concept independently
3. **Quiz** (Assessment) - Measures mastery against target score
4. **Challenge** (Optional) - No score limit; compete globally
5. **Review** (Retention) - Presented later in sequence to ensure retention

**Usage:**
- ✅ "Complete the Quiz stage to demonstrate mastery"
- ❌ "Complete the test stage"
- ✅ "Try the Learn stage if you need help"
- ❌ "Try the tutorial if you need help"

*Source: MLC Site Content, 2020; [Game Model](../08-games-registry-and-authoring/game-model.md)*

### User Role Terminology

Use these exact role names consistently across all interfaces:

| **Role Name** | **Plural** | **Usage Context** |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Student** | Students | Generic or Regular student users |
| **Generic Student** | Generic Students | Shared logins for General Music classes (no score tracking per individual) |
| **Teacher** | Teachers | Individual educators managing their students |
| **Teacher-Admin** | Teacher-Admins | Manages teachers and students; educational authority |
| **Subscriber-Administrator** | Subscriber-Administrators | Manages subscription, billing, seats; financial authority |
| **System Admin** | System Admins | MLC staff with full platform access |

**Notes:**
- "Subscriber-Administrator" is the full term; "Subscriber Admin" (no hyphen) is acceptable in UI labels due to space constraints
- Teacher-Admin and Subscriber-Administrator may be the same person (SOLO) or separate (ENSEMBLE)
- Never abbreviate roles to unclear terms like "Admin" without context

*Reference: [Roles Matrix](../02-roles-and-permissions/roles-matrix.md), [User Roles Detail](../00-ORIG-CONTEXT/USER ROLES detail.docx.txt)*

### Subscription and Seat Terminology

| **Preferred Term** | **Avoid** | **Notes** |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Seat** | License, slot, account | A seat is a student login with score tracking capability |
| **Generic username** | Shared account, guest login | Used for General Music classes where score tracking isn't needed per individual |
| **Subscription plan** | Package, tier, level | PRELUDE (free trial), SOLO (1 teacher), ENSEMBLE (multi-teacher) |
| **Monthly subscription** | Monthly plan, month-to-month | Paid monthly; seats can increase or decrease; can pause/restart |
| **Annual subscription** | Yearly plan, annual plan | Paid upfront; seats can increase only; 17% savings vs. monthly |
| **Prorated** | Adjusted, proportional | Automatic cost adjustment when seats change mid-billing cycle |
| **Grace period** | Extension, buffer | 30-day period after failed payment before service interruption |

*Reference: [Plans and Pricing](../14-payments-and-subscriptions/plans-and-pricing.md), [Seat Management](../14-payments-and-subscriptions/seat-management.md)*

| **Score history** | Score report, transcript, record | All scores achieved by a student over time |
| **Mastery** | Passing, completion, success | Achieving target score on Quiz demonstrates mastery |
| **High score** | Best score, top score | Highest score achieved in Challenge games (global leaderboard) |
| **Challenge Board** / **Leaderboard** | Scoreboard, rankings | Top 20 global scores for Challenge games |

### Educational Content Terminology

| **Preferred Term** | **Avoid** | **Context** |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Concept** | Topic, subject, skill | Discrete musical concept taught by each game (e.g., "intervals") |
| **Level** | Grade, tier, difficulty | Games organized by progressive difficulty: Levels 1-6+ |
| **Group** | Category, type, unit | Major concept groupings: Rhythm, Pitch, Melody, Chords, etc. |

## Grammar, Punctuation, and Style Conventions

### Grammar and Mechanics

#### Capitalization
- **Product names**: MusicLearningCommunity.com, MLC, Terry Treble, TerryTreble.com
- **Role names**: Student, Teacher, Teacher-Admin, Subscriber-Administrator (capitalize when referring to specific roles)
- **Educational terms**: Lifetime Musician (both capitalized as proper term)
- **Game stages**: Learn, Play, Quiz, Challenge, Review (capitalize when referring to specific stages)
- **UI elements**: Dashboard, Settings, Help Center (capitalize when referring to specific navigation items)
- **Sentence case for most UI text**: "Create new assignment" (not "Create New Assignment")
- **Headline case for document titles and major sections**

#### Numbers and Dates
- Spell out numbers one through nine in body text; use numerals for 10+
- Always use numerals in UI labels, tables, data displays: "5 students," "3 games remaining"
- Use numerals for ages, scores, counts: "Ages 6-18," "Target score: 85"
- Date format: Month Day, Year (e.g., "March 15, 2025") in user-facing text
- ISO format for data/API contexts: YYYY-MM-DD

#### Abbreviations and Acronyms
- Spell out on first use, then abbreviate: "Music Teachers National Association (MTNA)"
- Common acronyms that don't need spelling out: MIDI, USB, PDF, CSV, API (in technical contexts)
- Avoid abbreviations in student-facing content unless widely known
- Never abbreviate for brevity in critical instructions (e.g., don't write "config" for "configuration")

### Punctuation

#### Commas
- Use serial comma (Oxford comma): "rhythm, pitch, and melody"
- Use commas to separate UI breadcrumbs with spaces: Dashboard / Assignments / Create

#### Quotation Marks
- Use double quotes for direct quotations from testimonials or documentation
- Use double quotes around UI elements when referenced in body text: Click "Create Assignment"
- Avoid scare quotes or unnecessary emphasis quotes

#### Hyphens and Dashes
- Hyphenate compound modifiers: "self-paced learning," "step-by-step process"
- Use en dash (–) for ranges with spaces: "ages 6 – 18" (or use "ages 6-18" without spaces)
- Use em dash (—) for emphasis or breaks in thought—like this

#### Ampersands
- Avoid in body text; use "and" instead
- Exception: Brand names (Piano Adventures), company names if part of official name
- Acceptable in UI labels where space is constrained: "Terms & Conditions"

### Lists and Formatting

#### Bulleted Lists
- Use for unordered, related items
- Capitalize first word of each item
- Use punctuation consistently: either all items end with periods (if full sentences) or none do
- Keep items parallel in structure: all start with verbs, all start with nouns, etc.

**Example:**
- Create students with unique usernames
- Assign learning sequences to each student
- Monitor progress through score history
- Adjust assignments based on mastery

#### Numbered Lists
- Use for sequential steps or prioritized items
- Capitalize first word
- End with period if full sentence; omit if fragment
- Use imperative voice for instructions: "1. Click Create Assignment. 2. Select students."

#### Tables
- Use for comparison, specifications, or data display
- Keep headers concise and parallel in structure
- Use sentence case for headers
- Left-align text columns; right-align numeric columns

### Voice and Verb Usage

#### Active vs. Passive Voice
- **Prefer active voice**: "The system records your score" (not "Your score is recorded by the system")
- **Acceptable passive when action is more important than actor**: "Your subscription is paused until March 15"
- **Avoid passive when it obscures responsibility**: "An error occurred" → "We couldn't load this page"

#### Imperative Voice for Instructions
- Lead with verbs in instructions: "Click Create," "Select students," "Enter username"
- Omit unnecessary subjects: "Create assignment" (not "You should create an assignment")

#### Present Tense for UI States
- "Your assignment is ready" (not "Your assignment has been created")
- "You have 3 games remaining" (not "You will have 3 games remaining")

### Contractions

- **Students**: Use contractions freely to sound friendly and conversational
  - ✅ "You're doing great! Let's try another game."
- **Teachers**: Use contractions in conversational contexts; avoid in formal instructions
  - ✅ "You've assigned 5 games." ❌ "You've to select at least one student."
- **Admins**: Use sparingly; prefer full forms in business/financial contexts
  - ✅ "Your subscription is active" (not "Your subscription's active")
- **Errors**: Avoid contractions in critical error messages
  - ✅ "We cannot process your payment" (not "We can't process your payment")

---

## Content Hierarchy and Information Architecture

### Progressive Disclosure

Present information in layers, revealing complexity only when needed:

1. **Primary action/outcome** (always visible)
2. **Essential context** (visible by default)
3. **Supporting details** (expandable/collapsible)
4. **Advanced options** (behind "Advanced" or "More options")
5. **Technical details** (linked to help documentation)

**Example: Subscription Management**
```
Primary: "Your plan: Ensemble Monthly • $45.00/month • Next billing: March 15"
Essential: "23 of 25 seats used • Add or remove seats anytime"
Supporting: [Expand] "Your current plan includes..." (pricing breakdown)
Advanced: [Manage billing] → Full billing interface
Technical: [Learn about prorated billing] → Help Center article
```

### Scannable Content Patterns

Users scan, they don't read. Optimize for scanning:

- **Inverted pyramid**: Most important information first
- **Frontload keywords**: Start with action verbs or key terms
- **Use visual hierarchy**: Headers, bold, bullets, whitespace
- **Chunk related information**: Group into logical sections with clear headers
- **Provide summaries**: TL;DR at top of long content

**Example: Good Scannability**
```
✅ Create Assignment
Select students → Choose sequence → Set due date → Assign

Students will see:
• Next game in sequence
• Progress indicator
• Due date reminder
```

**Example: Poor Scannability**
```
❌ Assignment Creation
When you create an assignment, you'll need to first select the students 
that you want to assign it to, and then you can choose from one of the 
available sequences in the system, and you might also want to set a due 
date if that's something you want to track, and then finally you can assign it.
```

## Cross-Role Content Consistency

### Shared Terminology Across Roles

When the same concept appears in multiple role contexts, use consistent terminology:

| **Concept** | **Student View** | **Teacher View** | **Admin View** |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Login credentials** | "Your username and password" | "Student username and password" | "Member credentials" |
| **Game completion** | "You finished the game!" | "Student completed Rhythm Level 2 Quiz" | "Game completion rate: 87%" |
| **Subscription status** | N/A (students don't see) | "Your subscription is active" | "Ensemble Monthly • Active • Renews March 15" |
| **Score achievement** | "Your score: 92 • Target: 85 • Great job!" | "Student score: 92/85 target" | "Average Quiz score: 87%" |

### Action-Consequence Pairs

When an action in one role affects another role's experience, use consistent language to describe the relationship:

| **Teacher Action** | **Student Experience** |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| "Assign Lifetime Musician sequence" | "Your teacher assigned you games to play" |
| "Create assignment: 5 games due March 15" | "New assignment: 5 games • Due March 15" |
| "Remove student from class" | "You've been moved to a different class" |

| **Admin Action** | **Teacher/Student Experience** |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| "Pause subscription until May 1" | "Your subscription is paused until May 1. Students cannot log in." |
| "Add 10 seats" | "You can now create up to 30 students" |
| "Reduce seats from 30 to 20" | "Seat limit: 20 students (10 students must be removed to stay within limit)" |

---

## Content Localization and Internationalization

### Writing for Translation

While MLC 5.0 launches in English, all copy should be written in a way that supports future localization:

#### Best Practices

1. **Avoid idioms and colloquialisms**
   - ❌ "You're on a roll!" → ✅ "You're doing great!"
   - ❌ "Piece of cake" → ✅ "This is easy"

2. **Use complete sentences**
   - ❌ "Due: March 15" → ✅ "Due date: March 15, 2025"

3. **Avoid cultural references specific to US/English contexts**
   - ❌ "Hit a home run!" → ✅ "Excellent work!"

4. **Provide context for standalone strings**
   - ❌ String: "Save" (Could mean "save money" or "save file")
   - ✅ String: "SaveAssignment" | Context: "Button to save assignment draft"

5. **Avoid concatenation**
   - ❌ "You have " + count + " games remaining"
   - ✅ "You have {count} games remaining" (parameterized string)

6. **Allow space for expansion**
   - German text can be 30% longer than English
   - Design UI with flexible text containers

#### Cultural Considerations

- **Names**: Support various name formats (first/last not universal)
- **Dates**: Use ISO format in data; localize for display
- **Currency**: Support multiple currency symbols and formats
- **Musical notation**: Solfège already supported (do, re, mi vs. C, D, E)
- **Reading direction**: Design supports RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew) in future

*Reference: [Localization and Internationalization](../01-ux-design-system/localization-internationalization.md)*

## Content Strategy: When to Duplicate vs. Reference

### Duplication Criteria

Duplicate content across documents when:
- Information is critical to the immediate task and shouldn't require navigation
- Role-specific adaptation is needed (e.g., explaining same concept to students vs. teachers)
- Content is brief and changes infrequently

### Linking/Reference Criteria

Link to canonical source instead of duplicating when:
- Information is detailed, technical, or comprehensive
- Content changes frequently (pricing, technical specs, legal terms)
- Information serves multiple audiences without adaptation
- Deep context exists in another specialized document

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Duplicate**: Brief explanation of "target score" in student game interface
- ✅ **Reference**: Detailed scoring algorithm → Link to [Assignment Progress Tracking](../10-assignments-engine/assignment-progress-tracking.md)
- ✅ **Duplicate**: Role-specific tone guidance in each copy guide
- ✅ **Reference**: Core voice principles → Link to this document (copy-guidelines.md)
