# Copy Guide Admins

## Purpose

This document provides detailed copy and content guidelines specifically for administrator-facing content (Subscriber-Admin and Teacher-Admin roles). While [Screen Text and Copy Guidelines](../01-ux-design-system/screen-text-and-copy.md) covers platform-wide messaging across all roles, this guide focuses exclusively on the unique needs, vocabulary, and communication patterns for writing content that supports effective organizational management, financial oversight, and operational decision-making.

The goal is to create copy that is simultaneously:
- **Professional**: Appropriate for business and institutional contexts
- **Transparent**: Clear about financial, operational, and data realities
- **Efficient**: Scannable, action-oriented, and time-saving
- **Comprehensive**: Providing complete information for informed decisions
- **Empowering**: Enabling administrators to manage their organizations effectively

## Scope

### Included
- Subscriber Dashboard messaging and navigation labels
- Billing and subscription management copy
- Member management and organizational hierarchy text
- Financial reports and analytics descriptions
- Seat management and pricing information
- Bulk operations and administrative tools
- System configuration and settings
- Administrative notifications and alerts
- Teacher-Admin educational management copy
- Role delegation and permission management

### Excluded
- Teacher-facing content (see [Copy Guide Teachers](./copy-guide-teachers.md))
- Student-facing content (see [Copy Guide Students](./copy-guide-students.md))
- Technical system administration content (System Admin role)
- Marketing and promotional copy (outside learning platform)
- Legal documents (terms, privacy policy, compliance)

## Core Principles for Admin Copy

### 1. Business-First Language

**Principle**: Administrators are managing subscriptions, finances, and organizational structures. Copy should reflect business realities and financial transparency.

**Rationale**: Unlike teachers (focused on education) and students (focused on learning), admins need clear business information to make decisions about subscriptions, seats, and organizational structure.

**Do's**:
- ✅ "Your current plan: Ensemble • $0.20/month per student over 20 seats"
- ✅ "Next billing date: March 15, 2025 • $45.00"
- ✅ "Add 10 seats for $2.00/month (prorated)"
- ✅ "Total monthly cost: $127.40 • 47 active students of 50 seats"

**Don'ts**:
- ❌ "Unlock more learning!" (too marketing-focused)
- ❌ "Your studio is growing!" (too cheerful for business context)
- ❌ "Premium features available" (unclear pricing)
- ❌ Hiding costs or making pricing unclear

### 2. Data Transparency and Honesty

**Principle**: Provide complete, accurate information about usage, costs, and organizational performance without sugarcoating.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "15 of 25 seats unused • Consider reducing seats at renewal to save $3.00/month"
- ✅ "Payment failed • Update payment method to restore service"
- ✅ "3 students have not logged in for 30+ days"
- ✅ "Your subscription will terminate in 7 days unless payment is received"

**Avoid**:
- ❌ "Everything looks great!" (when seats are underutilized)
- ❌ "Minor billing issue" (when payment has failed)
- ❌ Hiding negative metrics or problems
- ❌ Overly optimistic interpretations of data

### 3. Efficiency Over Explanation

**Principle**: Administrators are busy. Lead with action and outcome, minimize explanatory text.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Add seats" (button label)
- ✅ "Export member list as CSV"
- ✅ "5 students need attention"
- ✅ Navigation: "Members • Billing • Reports • Settings"

**Avoid**:
- ❌ "Click here to add more student seats to your subscription"
- ❌ "You can export your member list by clicking this button"
- ❌ "Would you like to view reports about your organization?"
- ❌ Lengthy introductions before action buttons

### 4. Role-Specific Context

**Principle**: Subscriber-Admin and Teacher-Admin have different responsibilities. Copy should reflect their specific scope and concerns.

**Subscriber-Admin Focus**:
- ✅ "Manage subscription and billing"
- ✅ "Current monthly cost: $127.40"
- ✅ "Payment method: Visa ••••1234"
- ✅ "Delegate educational management to Teacher-Admin"

**Teacher-Admin Focus** (Ensemble only):
- ✅ "Manage 8 teachers and 156 students"
- ✅ "Contact Subscriber-Admin to add seats"
- ✅ "Create teacher accounts and assign students"
- ✅ "View program-wide learning analytics"

## Administrator Voice Characteristics

### Core Attributes

#### Transparent and Direct
Administrators need unvarnished truth to make business decisions.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Payment failed. Your subscription will be suspended in 3 days."
- ✅ "Seat utilization: 42 of 50 (84%) • 8 seats unused"
- ✅ "Annual plan: No seat reductions until renewal on August 1, 2025"
- ❌ "We're having a little trouble with your payment" (too soft)

#### Professional and Institutional
Language appropriate for schools, studios, and business contexts.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Organizational dashboard"
- ✅ "Member directory"
- ✅ "Financial overview"
- ✅ "Administrative tools"
- ❌ "Your music family" (too casual)
- ❌ "Studio buddies" (inappropriate for schools)

#### Action-Oriented and Scannable
Lead with verbs, use tables and lists, enable quick scanning.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Add seats • Export data • View reports • Manage billing"
- ✅ Formatted tables with clear columns and numbers
- ✅ Dashboard metrics in large numbers with labels
- ❌ Paragraphs of explanatory text
- ❌ Burying action items in narrative

#### Empowering Without Overwhelming
Provide complete information without creating decision paralysis.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Most common: Add 5 seats • $1.00/month"
- ✅ "Quick start: Invite teachers → Create students → Assign sequences"
- ✅ Progressive disclosure: "Show advanced options"
- ❌ Showing all 50 configuration options at once
- ❌ "Configure these 12 settings before continuing"

### Tone by Context

#### Subscription and Billing
- **Clear, direct, financially transparent**
- Show exact costs, dates, and terms
- Example: "Next billing: March 15 • $127.40 • Visa ••••1234"

#### Member Management
- **Efficient, scannable, organized**
- Show counts, roles, and status at a glance
- Example: "47 members • 2 Teacher-Admins • 8 Teachers • 37 Students"

#### Reports and Analytics
- **Data-driven, comparative, actionable**
- Provide numbers, trends, and context
- Example: "Class average: 87% • 43 of 47 students active this week • 4 need attention"

#### System Configuration
- **Clear, cautious, confirmatory**
- Explain impact before changes
- Example: "Delete teacher account? This will reassign 12 students to your account."

#### Alerts and Problems
- **Direct, solution-focused, urgent when appropriate**
- State problem, impact, and solution
- Example: "Payment failed. Update payment method within 3 days to avoid suspension."

## Open Questions

1. **Billing Dispute Language**: What tone should we use for serious billing issues (chargebacks, fraud, collections)? Need legal and billing team input on required language.

2. **Multi-Organization Admins**: Some Subscriber-Admins manage multiple organizations (e.g., studio chains). How do we adapt copy for switching between organizations? Need UX research.

3. **Financial Forecasting**: Should we show projected annual costs or savings for subscription changes? Could help decision-making but might overcomplicate interface.

4. **Teacher-Admin Scope Visualization**: How do we best visualize which teachers/students are in a Teacher-Admin's scope vs. outside it? Need UX design input.

5. **Automated Recommendations**: Should admins receive AI-generated recommendations for seat optimization, cost savings, or organizational structure? What guardrails are needed?

6. **Data Export Formatting**: What level of detail should admin exports include? Should we offer multiple export formats (summary vs. detailed)? Need product owner input.

7. **Compliance Notifications**: As COPPA, FERPA, and GDPR requirements evolve, how do we ensure admin copy stays compliant without legal review for every change? Need compliance framework.

8. **Subscription Pause Messaging**: For monthly subscriptions that can be paused, what's the optimal way to explain pause vs. cancel vs. downgrade? Need A/B testing.

9. **Teacher-Admin Onboarding**: Should Teacher-Admins receive different onboarding than Subscriber-Admins? What copy best explains their limited scope? Need user research.

10. **ROI Language**: Should we explicitly show "ROI" or "cost per student improvement" metrics to admins? Is this too sales-focused for the learning platform context? Need stakeholder input.
