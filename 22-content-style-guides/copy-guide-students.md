# Copy Guide Students

## Purpose

This document provides detailed copy and content guidelines specifically for student-facing content (ages 6-18). While [Screen Text and Copy Guidelines](../01-ux-design-system/screen-text-and-copy.md) covers platform-wide messaging across all roles, this guide focuses exclusively on the unique needs, vocabulary, and psychological considerations for writing content that resonates with young music learners.

The goal is to create copy that is simultaneously:
- **Educational**: Supporting music literacy and Lifetime Musician development
- **Motivational**: Encouraging consistent practice and growth mindset
- **Age-Appropriate**: Matching cognitive and emotional development levels
- **Non-Threatening**: Reducing anxiety and building confidence
- **Fun**: Maintaining the "playing games" perception over "studying music"

## Scope

### Included
- Dashboard messaging and navigation labels for students
- Game descriptions, instructions, and feedback
- Assignment descriptions and progress indicators
- Achievement and gamification messaging
- Error messages and help text for students
- Motivational and encouragement copy
- Tutorial and onboarding content
- Age-specific vocabulary guidelines
- Emotional state handling (frustration, success, confusion)

### Excluded
- Teacher-facing or parent-facing content (see [Copy Guide Teachers](./copy-guide-teachers.md) and [Copy Guide Admins](./copy-guide-admins.md))
- Technical documentation and API messaging
- Administrative or billing-related content
- Marketing and promotional copy (outside learning platform)

## Core Principles for Student Copy

### 1. "Playing" Not "Studying"

**Principle**: Students should feel they are playing engaging games, not doing homework or studying theory.

**Rationale**: As stated in MLC's founding philosophy: "Students think they are playing, but you know they're learning." This reduces anxiety and increases engagement with educational content.

**Do's**:
- ✅ "Ready to play your next game?"
- ✅ "Choose a game and start playing!"
- ✅ "You're on a roll! Play another?"
- ✅ "Let's explore new musical adventures!"

**Don'ts**:
- ❌ "Complete your music theory homework"
- ❌ "Study the next lesson"
- ❌ "Memorize these musical concepts"
- ❌ "Take this test"

### 2. Success-Oriented Language

**Principle**: Frame all interactions around progress, achievement, and capability rather than failure or deficiency.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "You're getting closer! Try once more." (not "You failed")
- ✅ "This is a tricky one. Let's practice together." (not "This is hard")
- ✅ "Almost there! Your score is improving!" (not "You didn't reach the target")
- ✅ "Keep going! Each play makes you better." (not "You need more practice")

### 3. Clear Next Steps

**Principle**: Students should always know exactly what to do next without confusion or decision paralysis.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Play this next" with prominent visual button
- ✅ "You've finished this game! Ready for the next one?"
- ✅ "Your assignment has 3 games. Let's start with the first!"
- ✅ "Great job! Click 'Continue' to keep going."

### 4. Immediate Positive Reinforcement

**Principle**: Celebrate every success, large or small, to build confidence and motivation.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Fantastic! You scored [X] points!"
- ✅ "Wow! You're mastering this skill!"
- ✅ "Great work! You got [X] correct!"
- ✅ "You're becoming a better musician every day!"

## Age-Specific Language Guidelines

### Vocabulary Complexity

**Ages 6-8 (Early Elementary)**:
- Use simple, concrete words (1-2 syllables preferred)
- Short sentences (5-8 words)
- Present tense, active voice
- Familiar concepts from daily life
- Examples: "Let's play!", "Good job!", "Try again!", "You did it!"

**Ages 9-12 (Late Elementary/Middle School)**:
- Introduce music-specific vocabulary with context
- Slightly longer sentences (8-12 words)
- Can handle simple conditionals ("If you..., then...")
- Beginning to appreciate achievement language
- Examples: "You're mastering rhythm!", "Challenge yourself!", "Level up your skills!"

**Ages 13-18 (High School)**:
- More sophisticated vocabulary and music terminology
- Can handle complex instructions and multi-step processes
- Appreciates autonomy and self-direction language
- Values competitive and social elements
- Examples: "Compete on the global leaderboard", "Track your progress over time", "Customize your learning path"

### Sentence Structure by Age

**Young Students (6-8)**:
```
"Play this game." (Simple command)
"You're doing great!" (Simple praise)
"Let's learn about notes!" (Invitation)
```

**Middle Students (9-12)**:
```
"This game helps you learn to read notes on the staff." (Purpose statement)
"You scored 85 points! That's excellent progress!" (Achievement + context)

```

**Older Students (13-18)**:
```
"Master this concept to advance your sight-reading ability." (Goal-oriented)
"Your performance has improved by 20% this week." (Data-driven feedback)
"Choose between the standard sequence or challenge mode." (Autonomy)
```

**Avoid**:
- ❌ "You keep failing this game"
- ❌ "This shouldn't be this hard"
- ❌ "Most students get this faster"
- ❌ Any shame-inducing language

### When Students Are Succeeding

**Indicators**: High scores, completing assignments, achieving badges

- ✅ "Here's how this game works..." (with simple instructions)
- ✅ "Watch this short video to see how it's done."
- ✅ "Not sure what to do? That's okay! Let's learn together."

**Progressive Help Strategy**:
1. **Tooltip level**: Brief hint on hover
2. **Inline help**: Short explanation with example
3. **Tutorial video**: Step-by-step visual guide
4. **Teacher message**: "Ask your teacher for help with [concept]"

### When Students Need Encouragement

**Indicators**: Low scores, irregular practice, minimal engagement

**Copy Approach**:
- ✅ "You practiced [X] days this week! Can you make it [X+1] next week?"
- ✅ "Every musician starts as a beginner. You're making progress!"
- ✅ "You're [X]% better than last week!"
- ✅ "Your [X] streak is impressive! Keep it going!"
- ✅ "Small practice sessions every day make you a better musician!"

## Musical Terminology for Students

### Introducing New Terms

**Pattern**: `[Term] + [Simple Definition] + [Why It Matters]`

**Examples**:
- "**Pitch** is how high or low a note sounds. Learning pitch helps you play the right notes!"
- "**Rhythm** is the pattern of beats in music. Mastering rhythm makes your playing sound great!"
- "**Melody** is the tune you sing or hum. Reading melody helps you learn new songs faster!"
- "**Chords** are groups of notes played together. Recognizing chords helps you play music by ear!"

### Progressive Terminology Building

**Stage 1 (Beginner)**: Use everyday language
- "High notes and low notes" → eventually "Pitch"
- "Beat patterns" → eventually "Rhythm"
- "Music reading" → eventually "Sight-reading"

**Stage 2 (Intermediate)**: Introduce proper terms with context
- "Pitch (how high or low notes sound)"
- "Intervals (the distance between two notes)"
- "Key signature (which notes are sharp or flat)"

**Stage 3 (Advanced)**: Use standard musical terminology
- "Harmonic progression"
- "Melodic contour"
- "Rhythmic subdivision"

## Copy Patterns for Common Scenarios

### Dashboard Welcome Messages

**Morning/Daytime**:
- "Good morning, [Name]! Ready to make music today?"
- "Hey [Name]! Let's play some games!"
- "Welcome back, [Name]! Your next adventure awaits!"

**Evening**:
- "Good evening, [Name]! Time for some music fun!"
- "Hey [Name]! Let's finish the day with music!"
- "Welcome back, [Name]! Let's play before dinner!"

**After Absence**:
- "Welcome back, [Name]! We missed you! Your games are ready."
- "Hey [Name]! You've been away. Let's get back to playing!"
- "Good to see you again, [Name]! Let's pick up where you left off."

### Assignment Descriptions

**Formula**: `[Action Verb] + [Skill] + [Benefit/Outcome]`

**Examples**:
- "Play rhythm games to improve your timing!"
- "Practice note reading to play songs faster!"
- "Master intervals to recognize melodies by ear!"
- "Learn scales to unlock advanced techniques!"

### Progress Feedback

- "You're doing great! Keep going!"
- "[X] out of [Y] correct! Nice work!"
- "Excellent timing!"
- "Perfect! You nailed that one!"

**After Game Completion**:
- "You scored [X] points! [Encouraging comment based on score]"
- "Game complete! You earned [X] points and [Y] stars!"
- "Fantastic! You mastered this game! [Badge earned]"

**Score-Based Feedback**:

```
"Oops! Something went wrong."
[Simple explanation]
"Here's what you can do:"
• [Action step 1]
• [Action step 2]
"Don't worry - your progress is saved!"
```

**Example**:

## Terry Treble Integration

### Character Voice

Terry Treble serves as the friendly guide and mascot for younger students. Use Terry's voice for:
- Tutorial introductions
- Achievement celebrations
- Encouragement during difficult moments
- Educational explanations

**Terry's Voice Characteristics**:
- Friendly and enthusiastic
- Never talks down to students
- Uses "we" language (inclusive)
- Occasionally uses musical puns
- Always encouraging and positive

**Examples**:
- "Hi there! I'm Terry Treble, and I'm here to help you become an amazing musician!"
- "Wow! You and I make a great team! Let's keep learning together!"
- "That was note-able! (Get it? Note-able?) Great job!"
- "Even I had to practice this one many times. You're doing great!"

### When to Use Terry

**Use Terry**:
- ✅ Tutorial and onboarding sequences
- ✅ First-time game introductions
- ✅ Achievement unlocks and celebrations
- ✅ Encouraging messages after struggles
- ✅ Educational tips and musical facts

**Don't Use Terry**:
- ❌ Technical error messages
- ❌ Privacy or security notices
- ❌ Formal assessment feedback
- ❌ Every single message (would become overwhelming)

## Accessibility and Inclusion

### Writing for Screen Readers

**Pattern**: `[Element Type] + [Element Purpose] + [Current State]`

**Examples**:
- "Button: Play Game - Rhythm Factory"
- "Progress bar: 7 out of 10 games completed - 70 percent"
- "Badge earned: Five Day Streak - Unlocked today"
- "Link: View your score history"

### Supporting Neurodiverse Learners

**Language Considerations**:
- Use literal language (avoid idioms and sarcasm)
- Provide explicit instructions rather than implied expectations
- Break complex tasks into numbered steps
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Provide visual supports for text instructions

**Examples**:
✅ "Click the blue 'Play' button to start the game."
❌ "When you're ready, go ahead and jump in!"

✅ "To play this game: 1) Choose a note, 2) Click the correct key, 3) Check if you're right"
❌ "Just play the notes on the keyboard"

### Special Needs Success Language

As noted in MLC's historical documentation, the platform has proven benefits for students with special needs. Copy should:
- Celebrate any progress, not just mastery
- Acknowledge effort as much as outcome
- Provide multiple ways to demonstrate understanding
- Never compare to other students
- Focus on personal growth

**Examples**:
- "You played the game all the way through! That's an achievement!"
- "You tried [X] times. That shows you don't give up!"
- "Every time you practice, your brain gets stronger!"
- "You're improving at your own pace. That's perfect!"

## Behavioral Psychology Principles

### Growth Mindset Language

**Use**:
- ✅ "You can learn this with practice"
- ✅ "Your skills are improving"
- ✅ "Mistakes help you learn"
- ✅ "You're getting better every time"

**Avoid**:
- ❌ "You're naturally talented" (fixed mindset)
- ❌ "This is easy for you" (undermines effort)
- ❌ "You're smart" (ability-focused)
- ❌ "Some people are just musical" (deterministic)

### Variable Reward Timing

**Principle**: Vary the timing and type of praise to maintain engagement

**Implementation**:
- Consistent immediate feedback ("Correct!")
- Intermittent special praise ("Wow! That was perfect!")
- Unexpected achievements ("Surprise! You earned a bonus badge!")
- Delayed recognition ("Your week's practice earned you...")

### Social Proof and Comparison

**Safe Competition**:
- ✅ "Beat your personal best!"
- ✅ "You're in the top 20 this week!"
- ✅ "Challenge friends to beat your score!"

**Avoid Harmful Comparison**:
- ❌ "You're behind [student name]"
- ❌ "The class average is higher than your score"
- ❌ "Only 3 students haven't finished this yet"

## Implementation Guidelines

### Copy Review Checklist

Before publishing student-facing copy, verify:

- [ ] Language is age-appropriate for target audience (6-18)
- [ ] Tone is encouraging and positive
- [ ] Gaming terminology is used over academic language
- [ ] Next steps are clear and actionable
- [ ] No shame-inducing or failure-focused language
- [ ] Technical terms are defined when first introduced
- [ ] Copy is accessible to screen readers
- [ ] Message supports growth mindset
- [ ] Emotional state of student is considered
- [ ] Length is appropriate (shorter for younger students)

### A/B Testing Priorities

Test different copy approaches for:
1. **Welcome messages**: Formal vs. casual greetings
2. **Error messages**: Brief vs. detailed explanations
3. **Achievement language**: Competition vs. personal growth
4. **Call-to-action buttons**: "Play" vs. "Start" vs. "Continue"
5. **Progress indicators**: Percentages vs. fraction vs. visual only

### Regional and Cultural Considerations

While English is the primary language, copy should:
- Avoid idioms that don't translate well ("piece of cake", "hit the nail on the head")
- Use universal musical terminology (Italian terms are globally recognized)
- Be sensitive to different educational cultures (competition emphasis varies)
- Consider translation requirements for future localization

## Open Questions

1. **AI-Generated Encouragement**: Should we use AI to generate personalized encouragement based on student's specific progress patterns? What guardrails are needed?

2. **Voice Customization**: Should students be able to choose the "personality" of their interface copy (more formal vs. very casual)?

3. **Age Detection**: How do we automatically adjust copy complexity based on student age? Should teachers be able to override this?

4. **Cultural Localization**: Beyond translation, how do we adapt motivational language for different cultural contexts (e.g., emphasis on individual achievement vs. community contribution)?

5. **Reading Level Assessment**: Should we implement automatic reading level detection and adjustment for students who read above or below their age level?

6. **Parent Visibility**: Should parents be able to see all student-facing copy, or is some messaging appropriately private between platform and student?
