# Copy Guide Teachers

This document defines copy and content guidelines specifically for teacher-facing content across the MLC-LMS platform.

## Purpose

Establish a consistent, professional, and efficient voice for all communications with teachers (private studio instructors, school music teachers, and teacher-admins). This ensures that teacher-facing copy:

- **Respects professional expertise**: Acknowledges teachers as skilled educators who understand pedagogy
- **Optimizes for efficiency**: Uses clear, scannable language that saves time
- **Supports instructional goals**: Frames features as teaching tools, not just software functions
- **Builds confidence**: Positions the platform as a "tireless teaching assistant" that extends their reach

## Teacher Voice Characteristics

### Core Attributes

#### Professional and Pedagogically Grounded
Teachers are experts in their field. Copy should acknowledge their knowledge and support their teaching philosophy.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Align assignments with your teaching method"
- ✅ "Monitor student mastery through detailed score history"
- ❌ "Let us teach your students" (undermines teacher's role)
- ❌ "Music is fun!" (too simplistic for professionals)

#### Efficient and Action-Oriented
Teachers value time-saving tools. Lead with verbs and outcomes, minimize explanation.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Create assignment"
- ✅ "Export class scores as CSV"
- ✅ "View students needing attention"
- ❌ "You can create a new assignment by clicking here"
- ❌ "This feature allows you to..."

#### Supportive Without Being Prescriptive
Provide tools and insights; let teachers make instructional decisions.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Sarah has attempted Quiz 3 times without reaching target score"
- ✅ "Consider assigning review games for rhythm concepts"
- ❌ "You must assign these games next"
- ❌ "Sarah is failing" (judgmental)

#### Data-Informed and Outcomes-Focused
Teachers appreciate quantitative evidence of student progress.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "87% class mastery on Level 2 Rhythm games"
- ✅ "Average score: 94 (target: 80)"
- ✅ "Students playing games are 3-5 months ahead after one year"
- ❌ "Students are doing great!" (vague)

### Tone by Context

#### Dashboard and Overview Screens
- **Brief, scannable, prioritized**
- Show counts, status, and next actions
- Example: "5 students need attention • 3 assignments due this week"

#### Assignment Builder
- **Clear, step-by-step, confirmatory**
- Explain what will happen, not how to do it
- Example: "Assign Lifetime Musician Sequence, Level 1 to 12 students starting Monday"

#### Reports and Analytics
- **Objective, comparative, insight-driven**
- Lead with data, follow with interpretation when helpful
- Example: "Class average 78 (target 80) • 3 students below 70 may need additional support"

#### Error and Alert Messages
- **Calm, solution-focused, non-blaming**
- State the issue, provide fix, avoid panic
- Example: "Unable to save assignment. Check that all students have active accounts."

#### Bulk Operations
- **Explicit, confirmatory, reversible when possible**
- Always show impact scope before action
- Example: "Send message to 23 selected students?"

## Behavioral Rules and Validation

### Tone Adjustment Rules

**When something goes wrong:**
- De-escalate: "This occasionally happens" not "Critical error"
- Provide immediate fix: "Refresh the page" or "Try again in a moment"
- Assure data safety: "All student progress is saved"

**When teacher is new:**
- Provide context: "Most teachers start by assigning a sequence"
- Offer guidance without condescension: "Choose a method or use Lifetime Musician sequence"
- Show quick wins: "3 steps to your first assignment"

**When teacher is experienced:**
- Get out of the way: Minimal help text, clear labels, fast workflows
- Offer power features: Keyboard shortcuts, bulk operations, API access
- Provide depth on demand: "Advanced options" or "Show more filters"

### Consistency Rules

- **Button labels**: Always verb-first: "Create", "Export", "View", "Send"
- **Counts**: Always include count with list labels: "Students (23)", "Assignments (5)"
- **Dates**: Use relative dates for recent, absolute for historical: "Today", "Yesterday", "Mar 15, 2024"
- **Score display**: Always show score + target: "85 (target: 80)"
- **Student status**: Always explain status icon: Don't rely on color alone

### Validation and Confirmation

**Before destructive actions, always confirm with impact:**
- "Delete assignment for 12 students? This cannot be undone."
- "Remove Sarah Chen from your roster? Her score history will be preserved but inaccessible."

**After actions, confirm success and next step:**
- "Assignment created for 12 students. View on Dashboard or create another?"
- "Message sent to 8 students. Students will receive email notification."

- **Localization**: All teacher copy must support internationalization (see [Localization](../01-ux-design-system/localization-internationalization.md))

## Open Questions

1. **Regional Terminology Variations**: Should we adjust terminology for UK ("Class" vs "Form") or other English-speaking regions? Consider post-MVP localization.

2. **Teacher Certification Language**: When teachers achieve milestones (e.g., "100 students taught"), should we use gamification language or keep it professional? Need product owner input.

3. **Parent Communication Tone**: When teachers send messages that copy parents, should the copy adjust tone, or trust teacher to write appropriately? Currently assumes teacher writes for both audiences.

4. **Method Branding Compliance**: Do we need legal review of how we reference trademarked teaching method names (Piano Adventures®, Alfred's, RCM)? Need legal review.

5. **Advanced Features Naming**: For power-user features (API access, custom reporting, advanced filters), should we use technical terms or continue plain language? Need UX research with experienced teachers.

6. **Cross-Cultural Pedagogy**: Are there teaching terms that don't translate well or have different meanings in different music education traditions? Need input from international educators.
