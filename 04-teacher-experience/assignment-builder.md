## Teacher Workflows

### Create From Scratch
- Open Assignment Builder from the Teacher Dashboard (see `../04-teacher-experience/teacher-dashboard.md`).
- Search or browse content via Game/Sequence libraries (see `../08-games-registry-and-authoring/games-registry-overview.md` and `../09-sequences-and-curriculum-tools/sequence-model.md`).
- Drag learning elements onto the canvas, organize in the outline, and set properties.
- Configure progression, mastery, and completion criteria.
- Save draft; preview; publish to selected students or groups.

### Create From Sequence Template
- Choose a predefined sequence and generate an assignment scaffold.
- Adjust order, remove elements not needed, and add custom elements.
- Confirm mastery thresholds align with the sequenceâ€™s intent.
- Publish and optionally save as a reusable template.

### Quick Add Individual Games
- Use search to locate a specific game by name or ID.
- Add one or more stages (Learn, Play, Quiz, Challenge, Review) as discrete elements.
- Set per-stage retry and scoring rules to fit the goal (e.g., assessment vs. practice).

### Bulk Assign and Scheduling
- Select multiple classes or groups and schedule start/end dates.
- Use staggered release for weekly practice blocks.
- Apply the same template with differentiated mastery thresholds by group.


## Constraints and Edge Cases
- Assignments should not include unavailable or deprecated games. When a game is archived, show a non-blocking warning with a link to alternatives (see `../08-games-registry-and-authoring/games-stages-policy.md`).
- Stage selection must reflect canonical stage availability per game. Some games may omit certain stages.
- Preview should open game in an isolated context without affecting student analytics.
- When editing a published assignment, use versioning; students continue on the active version until teacher promotes a new version (see Version Control above).
- Respect role permissions: only `Teacher` and `Teacher-Admin` can create/publish; `Subscriber Admin` cannot modify pedagogy (see `../02-roles-and-permissions/roles-matrix.md`).
- Score policy alignment: ensure mastery thresholds map to the platform scoring system (see `../10-assignments-engine/assignment-progress-tracking.md`).


## Dependencies and Related Systems
- Content metadata and taxonomy come from the Games Registry (see `../08-games-registry-and-authoring/game-model.md`).
- Sequences and curriculum alignment rely on sequence tools (see `../09-sequences-and-curriculum-tools/sequence-authoring.md`).
- Student delivery and progress visuals appear in Assignment Play (reference `../03-student-experience/assignment-play.md`).
- Search and filters leverage the search architecture (see `../11-search-and-discovery/search-indexing.md`).
- Analytics roll up to teacher and admin reports (see `../15-analytics-and-reporting/teacher-reports-kpis.md`).


## Telemetry and Events
- Emit assignment lifecycle events aligned to the event model (see `../15-analytics-and-reporting/event-model.md`):
  - `assignment.created`, `assignment.updated`, `assignment.version.promoted`, `assignment.published`, `assignment.archived`.
  - Element-level mutations: `assignment.element.added`, `assignment.element.removed`, `assignment.element.reordered`, `assignment.rule.changed`.
- Include identifiers: assignmentId, versionId, teacherId, organizationId, elementIds, sequenceId (if applicable).
- Capture preview usage separately from student delivery to avoid skewing learning analytics.


## Permissions and Access
- Teachers can create, edit, and publish assignments to their owned students and groups.
- Teacher-Admins can manage assignments across teachers within the subscriber account.
- Subscriber Admins have read access for billing/visibility but cannot change content rules (see `../06-system-admin/user-permissions.md`).


## UX, Copy, and Accessibility References
- Follow copy standards and tone (see `../01-ux-design-system/screen-text-and-copy.md`).
- Ensure accessible keyboard navigation and screen reader labels (see `../16-accessibility-and-inclusion/keyboard-and-midi-access.md` and `../01-ux-design-system/a11y-standards.md`).
- Keep labels consistent with in-app terminology used across the Teacher Dashboard and All Games pages (see `../03-student-experience/all-games-library.md`).
