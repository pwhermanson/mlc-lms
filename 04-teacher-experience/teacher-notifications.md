# Teacher Notifications

## Purpose
Enable teachers to receive timely, relevant notifications about student progress, system updates, and important events that require their attention. This system ensures teachers stay informed about their students' learning activities, assignment completions, and any issues that may need intervention, while respecting their notification preferences and avoiding information overload.

## Scope
Included
- Real-time notifications for student assignment completions and achievements
- System announcements and updates relevant to teachers
- Student progress alerts (struggling students, exceptional performance)
- Assignment deadline reminders and overdue notifications
- New student registrations and account activations
- System maintenance and feature update notifications
- Emergency communications and urgent alerts
- Notification preferences and delivery channel management

Excluded
- Student-to-student notifications (handled in student experience)
- Cross-organization notifications (admin-level only)
- Billing and subscription notifications (handled by Subscriber-Admin)
- Technical system alerts (handled by System Admin)

## Data model (if applicable)
Reference: `../15-analytics-and-reporting/event-model.md` (events), `../13-messaging-and-notifications/in-app-notifications.md` (delivery)

Core entities (conceptual)
- TeacherNotification: `notificationId`, `teacherId`, `type`, `title`, `message`, `priority`, `readStatus`, `createdAt`, `expiresAt`
- NotificationPreference: `teacherId`, `channel`, `type`, `enabled`, `frequency`
- StudentProgressAlert: `alertId`, `studentId`, `teacherId`, `alertType`, `severity`, `context`, `resolvedAt`
- SystemAnnouncement: `announcementId`, `title`, `message`, `priority`, `targetRoles[]`, `publishedAt`, `expiresAt`

Notification types
- `assignment_completed`: Student completed an assignment
- `assignment_overdue`: Student has overdue assignments
- `student_achievement`: Student earned a badge or milestone
- `student_struggling`: Student needs attention (low scores, multiple failures)
- `new_student`: New student added to teacher's roster
- `system_announcement`: General system updates and news
- `maintenance_alert`: Scheduled maintenance notifications
- `emergency_alert`: Urgent system or safety notifications

## Behavior and rules
Notification generation
- Teachers receive notifications only for students in their roster (see `../02-roles-and-permissions/roles-matrix.md`)
- Teacher-Admin receives notifications for all students in their scope
- Notifications are generated based on student activity and system events
- Duplicate notifications are prevented through deduplication logic

Priority levels
- `critical`: Emergency alerts, system outages (immediate delivery)
- `high`: Student struggling alerts, overdue assignments (delivered within 1 hour)
- `normal`: Assignment completions, achievements (delivered within 4 hours)
- `low`: System announcements, general updates (delivered within 24 hours)

Delivery channels
- In-app notifications (always enabled)
- Email notifications (based on teacher preferences)
- Push notifications (if teacher has enabled mobile app)
- SMS notifications (for critical alerts only, opt-in required)

Notification preferences
- Teachers can customize which notification types they receive
- Channel preferences can be set per notification type
- Frequency controls: immediate, daily digest, weekly digest, disabled
- Quiet hours can be set to avoid notifications during specific times

Retention and cleanup
- Read notifications are retained for 30 days
- Unread notifications are retained for 90 days
- Critical notifications are retained for 1 year for audit purposes
- Automatic cleanup of expired notifications

## UX requirements (if applicable)
Notification center
- Accessible from teacher dashboard header with unread count badge
- List view with notification type icons, timestamps, and read/unread states
- Filtering by notification type, date range, and read status
- Bulk actions: mark as read, mark all as read, delete selected

Notification cards
- Clear visual hierarchy with notification type, title, and preview
- Action buttons for relevant notifications (view student, view assignment)
- Dismissible with undo option for accidental dismissals
- Expandable for full message content

Settings panel
- Toggle switches for each notification type
- Channel selection (in-app, email, push) per type
- Frequency settings (immediate, digest, disabled)
- Quiet hours configuration with timezone support
- Test notification button for each enabled channel

Accessibility
- Screen reader support for all notification content
- Keyboard navigation for all notification actions
- High contrast mode support for notification badges
- Color coding supplemented with icons and text labels

## Telemetry
Reference: `../15-analytics-and-reporting/event-model.md`
- teacher_notification_received: { notification_type, priority, channel }
- teacher_notification_read: { notification_id, time_to_read_seconds }
- teacher_notification_clicked: { notification_id, action_taken }
- teacher_notification_dismissed: { notification_id, dismissal_reason }
- teacher_notification_preference_changed: { preference_type, old_value, new_value }
- teacher_notification_delivery_failed: { channel, error_code, retry_count }

## Permissions
Reference: `../02-roles-and-permissions/roles-matrix.md`, `../02-roles-and-permissions/permissions-table.md`
- Teacher: receive notifications for their students, manage their own notification preferences
- Teacher-Admin: receive notifications for all students in their scope, manage notification preferences
- Subscriber-Admin: receive system-wide notifications, view notification delivery reports
- System Admin: send system announcements, manage notification delivery systems

- Email delivery: `../13-messaging-and-notifications/email-templates.md`, `../17-integrations/email-provider.md`

## Open questions
- Should teachers be able to set different notification preferences for different students or classes?
- What is the appropriate frequency for "student struggling" alerts to avoid alert fatigue?
- Should there be a notification digest feature that groups similar notifications together?
- How should notification preferences be handled when a teacher's role changes (e.g., from Teacher to Teacher-Admin)?
- Should there be a notification history export feature for teachers to review past communications?
