# Competency-Based Assessment

## Overview
Competency-based assessment and portfolio management specifications for skill-based learning evaluation.

## Purpose

While [Assignment Progress Tracking](../10-assignments-engine/assignment-progress-tracking.md) measures advancement through structured curricula, competency-based assessment focuses on demonstrating mastery of discrete musical skills regardless of the learning path taken. This specification enables:

- **Standards-Based Progression**: Students advance when they demonstrate competency, not based on seat time or assignment completion
- **Flexible Learning Paths**: Multiple routes to demonstrating the same competency
- **Evidence-Based Mastery**: Portfolio of artifacts proving skill achievement
- **Credential Management**: Formal recognition of competencies through badges, certificates, and external alignment
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifying specific skill deficiencies and recommending targeted interventions
- **Transfer Credit**: Recognizing competencies earned outside the MLC system

This system complements the existing assignment-based progression model by providing an alternative assessment framework aligned with competency-based education (CBE) principles and music education standards (National Core Arts Standards, MENC).

## Scope

### Included
- **Competency Framework**: Hierarchical skill taxonomy aligned with music education standards
- **Evidence Collection**: Portfolio management for capturing proof of competency achievement
- **Skill Mapping**: Relationship between learning elements (games, sequences) and competencies
- **Competency Tracking**: Progress monitoring at skill level (independent of assignments)
- **Adaptive Assessment**: Diagnostic tools for identifying competency gaps and strengths
- **Certification Management**: Issuing formal credentials for competency achievement
- **Standards Alignment**: Mapping competencies to external standards (MENC, Piano Adventures, RCM)
- **Transfer Credit**: Evaluating and recognizing prior learning and external certifications
- **Competency-Based Reporting**: Progress reports organized by skill domains rather than assignments

### Excluded
- **Assignment-based progress** (covered in [Assignment Progress Tracking](../10-assignments-engine/assignment-progress-tracking.md))
- **General game scoring mechanics** (covered in [Game Model](../08-games-registry-and-authoring/game-model.md))
- **Placement testing workflows** (covered in [Sequence Placements and EVAL](../09-sequences-and-curriculum-tools/sequence-placements-eval.md))
- **Badge UI and reward mechanics** (covered in [Badges System](../12-gamification/badges-system.md))
- **Teacher reporting dashboards** (covered in [Teacher Reports](../04-teacher-experience/teacher-reports.md))

## Description
Detailed competency-based assessment framework including skill mapping, portfolio management, competency tracking, adaptive assessment algorithms, and certification management for skill-based learning outcomes.

## Key Concepts

### Competency vs. Progress
- **Assignment Progress**: Measures completion of structured learning sequences (e.g., "75% through Piano Adventures Level 2A")
- **Competency Achievement**: Measures demonstration of specific skills (e.g., "Can accurately identify all intervals from 2nds through octaves")

**Example**: A student might complete 50% of a rhythm assignment but already demonstrate full competency in "identifying quarter and half note values"â€”in a competency-based model, they would receive credit and advance, potentially skipping redundant content.

### Competency Hierarchy

The MLC competency framework organizes skills into a four-level hierarchy:

1. **Domains**: Broad skill categories (e.g., Rhythm & Meter, Pitch & Melody)
2. **Competencies**: Specific, measurable skills (e.g., "Identify note values and rests")
3. **Sub-competencies**: Granular skill components (e.g., "Identify quarter notes and rests")
4. **Evidence Requirements**: Specific demonstrations needed to prove mastery

### Standards Alignment

All competencies map to one or more external standards:
- **National Core Arts Standards** (NCAS) for music education
- **MENC National Standards** (K-4, 5-8, 9-12)
- **Piano method curricula** (Piano Adventures, Alfred, Hal Leonard)
- **Royal Conservatory of Music** (RCM) examination requirements
- **State music education standards** (where applicable)

### Portfolio Evidence

Competency achievement requires documented evidence:
- **Performance recordings**: Audio/video of student playing
- **Assessment scores**: Passing scores on diagnostic games
- **Teacher observations**: Structured rubric evaluations
- **Project artifacts**: Compositions, arrangements, analyses
- **External credentials**: Certificates from recitals, competitions, RCM exams

}
```

## Behavior and Rules

### Competency Achievement Criteria

A competency is marked as "achieved" when:

1. **Sufficient Evidence**: Minimum number of evidence items collected
2. **Evidence Quality**: Combined evidence score meets threshold (typically 75+)
3. **Confidence Level**: Evidence confidence is at least "moderate"
4. **Teacher Verification** (optional): Teacher has reviewed and approved (if required by organization)
5. **Prerequisite Competencies**: All prerequisite competencies are achieved

**Achievement Calculation**:
```pseudo
achievement_score = sum(evidence_weight * evidence_confidence) / sum(evidence_weight)

if (achievement_score >= 75 
    AND evidence_count >= min_evidence_count
    AND confidence_level >= 'moderate'
    AND all_prerequisites_met) {
  status = 'achieved'
}
```

### Evidence Weighting and Confidence

Different evidence types carry different weights and confidence levels:

**Evidence Type Weights** (default):
- **Game scores**: 0.4 (reliable but limited context)
- **Performance recordings**: 0.8 (rich evidence but interpretation needed)
- **Teacher observations**: 0.9 (expert evaluation but subjective)
- **Projects**: 0.7 (demonstrates application but variable quality)
- **External credentials**: 1.0 (verified by third party)

**Confidence Levels**:
- **Low** (0-59%): Single piece of weak evidence or inconsistent performance
- **Moderate** (60-79%): Multiple pieces of evidence with some consistency
- **High** (80-94%): Strong, consistent evidence across multiple contexts
- **Verified** (95-100%): Teacher-verified and/or externally credentialed

### Competency Maintenance and Decay

Some competencies require ongoing practice to maintain:

**Maintenance Rules**:
1. **Static Competencies**: Theoretical knowledge (e.g., "Identify treble clef notes") - no decay
2. **Performance Competencies**: Skills requiring practice (e.g., "Play C Major scale") - decay after 90 days without evidence
3. **Maintenance Assessment**: If competency shows decay indicators, status changes to "needs_review"
4. **Re-assessment**: Student must provide new evidence to restore "achieved" status

**Decay Indicators**:
- No evidence of competency use in last 90 days
- Significant struggles on related competencies that depend on this one
- Teacher flags competency for re-assessment

### Adaptive Competency Assessment

The system can generate personalized assessment sequences to efficiently evaluate competency achievement:

**Adaptive Assessment Algorithm**:
1. **Start with diagnostic**: Administer broad assessment covering multiple competencies
2. **Identify strong areas**: Competencies where student shows immediate mastery
3. **Identify weak areas**: Competencies where student struggles
4. **Narrow focus**: Administer targeted assessments for unclear competencies
5. **Confirm boundaries**: Test edge cases to precisely identify competency ceiling
6. **Generate report**: Competency profile showing achieved, in-progress, and not-yet-attempted

This is similar to the EVAL sequence but focused on competency demonstration rather than placement.

### Competency-Based Progression

Organizations can enable competency-based progression where students:

1. **Advance by competency**: Move forward when competency is achieved, regardless of assignment completion
2. **Skip redundant content**: If a student demonstrates a competency, related games can be marked optional
3. **Fill gaps**: If assessment reveals missing competencies, targeted content is automatically assigned
4. **Set own pace**: Students work at their own speed, advancing when ready

**Progression Rules**:
```pseudo
if (competency_achieved) {
  // Skip future content that only addresses this competency
  mark_redundant_steps_optional(competency_id)
  
  // Unlock content that required this competency
  unlock_dependent_content(competency_id)
  
  // Check if sequence milestone reached
  if (all_required_competencies_for_level_achieved) {
    advance_to_next_level()
  }
}
```

### Certification Management

When a defined set of competencies is achieved, the system can issue formal certificates:

**Certificate Types**:
1. **Domain Certificates**: All competencies in a domain achieved (e.g., "Rhythm & Meter Mastery")
2. **Level Certificates**: All required competencies for a level achieved (e.g., "Level 2 Completion")
3. **Method Certificates**: Competencies aligned with external method completed (e.g., "Piano Adventures 2A")
4. **Custom Certificates**: Teacher-defined competency sets

**Certification Process**:
1. **Auto-detection**: System identifies when certificate criteria are met
2. **Teacher notification**: Teacher receives notification for review
3. **Teacher approval**: Teacher reviews evidence and approves certificate (or requests more evidence)
4. **Certificate generation**: System generates PDF certificate with student name, competencies, date
5. **Portfolio inclusion**: Certificate added to student's competency portfolio
6. **Public sharing**: Student can share certificate via public URL or download

### Gap Analysis and Recommendations

The system continuously analyzes competency gaps and recommends interventions:

**Gap Analysis**:
- **Identify missing competencies**: Compare student's achieved competencies to expected for their level
- **Identify weak competencies**: Competencies with low evidence scores or inconsistent performance
- **Identify prerequisite gaps**: Missing foundational competencies blocking advancement
- **Identify decay**: Previously achieved competencies showing maintenance concerns

**Recommendations**:
- **Targeted assignments**: Specific games/sequences that address identified gaps
- **Remediation sequences**: Custom learning paths for struggling competencies
- **Practice schedules**: Spaced repetition for competency maintenance
- **Teacher interventions**: Flag students needing one-on-one instruction

## Open Questions

### Framework Design
- Should competencies be granular (many small skills) or broader (fewer comprehensive skills)?
- How often should the competency framework be updated to reflect evolving music education standards?
- Should organizations be able to customize the core competency framework or only add extensions?

### Evidence and Assessment
- What is the optimal number of evidence items required per competency (balance thoroughness vs. burden)?
- Should game scores count equally across all games, or should certain games carry more weight?
- How should the system handle subjective teacher observations vs. objective game scores?
- Should students be able to challenge a "not achieved" determination and request re-assessment?

### Competency Progression
- Should competency-based progression be optional or required for all organizations?
- If a student achieves a competency through free play, should they still complete assigned content for that competency?
- How should the system balance structured sequences (linear) with competency-based progression (non-linear)?

### Certification and Credentials
- Who should have authority to issue certificates: only teachers, or also system-admins based on data?
- Should certificates expire, and if so, under what conditions?
- How should the system integrate with external credentialing systems (RCM, ABRSM, etc.)?
- What information should be included on certificates to make them meaningful and verifiable?

### Portfolio Management
- What file size limits should be imposed on portfolio artifacts (recordings, projects)?
- Should portfolios be exportable in standardized formats (e.g., IMS ePortfolio, Open Badges)?
- How long should portfolio evidence be retained after student account deactivation?
- Should there be privacy controls on what evidence is visible in shared portfolios?

### Maintenance and Decay
- Which competencies should be subject to maintenance requirements vs. considered permanent?
- What is the appropriate decay timeline (currently 90 days)?
- Should maintenance requirements vary by competency difficulty or student level?

### Standards Alignment
- How should the system handle conflicting or evolving standards from different organizations?
- Should competency mappings to standards be visible to students/parents, or only teachers?
- How can the system support international standards (e.g., ABRSM for UK, AMEB for Australia)?
