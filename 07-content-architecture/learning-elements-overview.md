# Learning Elements Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all learning elements in the MLC system and their relationships. Learning elements are the fundamental building blocks of the music learning experience, encompassing games, multimedia content, and interactive materials that support student progression.

## Purpose

This specification enables the systematic organization and management of all educational content within the MLC platform. It establishes the foundation for:

- **Content Architecture**: Defining how different types of learning materials relate to each other
- **Sequence Management**: Enabling the creation of structured learning paths that combine multiple element types
- **Progress Tracking**: Supporting assessment and analytics across all learning activities
- **Content Discovery**: Facilitating search and filtering of educational materials
- **Assignment Engine**: Powering the automatic presentation of appropriate content to students

## Scope

### Included
- **Game Elements**: Interactive learning games with multiple stages (Learn, Play, Quiz, Challenge, Review)
- **Multimedia Elements**: Videos, audio content, and instructional materials
- **Text Elements**: Labels, instructions, descriptions, and educational content
- **Reward Elements**: Badges, certificates, stickers, and achievement systems
- **Sequence Integration**: How elements combine to form learning sequences
- **Element Relationships**: Dependencies, prerequisites, and content associations

### Excluded
- **User Management**: Student, teacher, and admin roles (covered in [roles-and-permissions](../02-roles-and-permissions/))
- **Assignment Logic**: How elements are presented to students (covered in [assignment-model](assignment-model.md))
- **Game Mechanics**: Specific game play rules and interactions (covered in [game-model](../08-games-registry-and-authoring/game-model.md))

## Data Model

### Core Learning Element Types

#### Game Elements (GAM)
- **Structure**: Each game consists of 4-5 stages with specific purposes
- **Numbering**: GAM-XXXX-Y format where XXXX is the game number and Y is the stage
- **Stages**:
  - **Learn (1)**: Tutorial introducing the musical concept
  - **Play (2)**: Practice/drill routines for skill development
  - **Quiz (3)**: Assessment to test mastery of the concept
  - **Challenge (4)**: Optional competitive mode with unlimited scoring
  - **Review (5-7)**: Retention-focused repetition (1-3 review stages)

#### Video Elements (VID)
- **Types**: Game introductions, site tutorials, instructional content, entertainment
- **Numbering**: VID-XXX-YYYY-L format where XXX is type, YYYY is number, L is language
- **Integration**: Can precede or follow games in sequences

#### Audio Elements (AUD)
- **Types**: Musical examples, sound effects, instructional audio
- **Numbering**: AUD-XXX-YYYY-L format
- **Usage**: Support aural learning and provide musical context

#### Text Elements (TXT)
- **Types**: Labels, game text, sentences, paragraphs
- **Numbering**: TXT-XXX-YYYY-L format
- **Purpose**: Instructions, descriptions, and educational content

#### Reward Elements (RWD)
- **Types**: Stickers, badges, certificates
- **Numbering**: RWD-XXX-YYYY format
- **Triggering**: Based on achievement of target scores or completion milestones

### Element Relationships

#### Sequence Integration
- **Sequence Assignment Codes**: Combine element number with sequence and group identifiers
- **Ordering**: Elements appear in specific order within learning sequences
- **Dependencies**: Some elements may require completion of prerequisite elements

#### Content Associations
- **Concept Mapping**: Elements are tagged with musical concepts (pitch, rhythm, harmony, etc.)
- **Level Alignment**: Elements are organized by difficulty levels (Primary through Level 6)
- **Skill Categories**: Elements support specific musical skills (aural, visual, kinesthetic)

## Behavior and Rules

### Element Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Elements are created with unique identifiers and metadata
2. **Categorization**: Elements are classified by type, level, and concept
3. **Sequence Assignment**: Elements are placed in appropriate learning sequences
4. **Student Presentation**: Elements are presented to students based on their progress
5. **Completion Tracking**: Student interactions with elements are recorded
6. **Assessment**: Elements contribute to overall student progress evaluation

### Scoring and Assessment
- **Target Scores**: Each game element has defined target scores for mastery
- **Completion Tracking**: System records first play, last play, and highest scores
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual indicators show achievement status (green/yellow/red)
- **Retention Logic**: Review elements are presented at intervals to reinforce learning

### Content Validation
- **Element Integrity**: All elements must have valid identifiers and metadata
- **Sequence Coherence**: Elements in sequences must follow logical learning progression
- **Accessibility**: Elements must meet accessibility standards for diverse learners
- **Localization**: Elements support multiple languages and cultural contexts

## UX Requirements

### Student Interface
- **Element Presentation**: Clear visual distinction between different element types
- **Progress Indicators**: Immediate feedback on element completion and achievement
- **Navigation**: Intuitive movement between elements within sequences
- **Accessibility**: Support for keyboard navigation, screen readers, and assistive technologies

### Teacher Interface
- **Element Management**: Tools for viewing and managing learning elements
- **Sequence Review**: Ability to preview and modify learning sequences
- **Progress Monitoring**: Dashboards showing student interaction with elements
- **Content Discovery**: Search and filter tools for finding appropriate elements

### Admin Interface
- **Content Management**: Full CRUD operations for all element types
- **Analytics**: Comprehensive reporting on element usage and effectiveness
- **Quality Control**: Tools for reviewing and approving new elements
- **System Configuration**: Settings for element behavior and presentation

## Telemetry

### Element Interaction Events
- **element_viewed**: When a student accesses any learning element
- **element_started**: When a student begins interacting with an element
- **element_completed**: When a student finishes an element
- **element_abandoned**: When a student leaves an element without completion
- **score_achieved**: When a student reaches a target score
- **mastery_demonstrated**: When a student shows concept mastery

### Analytics Properties
- **element_id**: Unique identifier for the learning element
- **element_type**: Type of element (GAM, VID, AUD, TXT, RWD)
- **sequence_context**: Which sequence the element appears in
- **completion_time**: Time spent on the element
- **score_achieved**: Score obtained (for game elements)
- **attempt_count**: Number of attempts made
- **mastery_status**: Whether target score was achieved
