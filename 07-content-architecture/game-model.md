# Game Model

## Purpose

This document defines the structure and behavior of Games within the MLC-LMS platform. Games are the core learning elements that teach specific musical concepts through interactive, staged experiences designed to promote mastery and retention.

## Game Structure

### Core Components
- **Game ID**: Unique identifier for the game across all stages
- **Name**: Human-readable title of the game
- **Description**: Brief explanation of what the game teaches
- **Concept Category**: Primary musical concept (Pitch, Rhythm, Melody, etc.)
- **Difficulty Level**: Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced
- **Target Age Range**: Recommended age group for the game
- **Instrument Type**: Piano, General Music, etc.

### Stage Architecture
Each game consists of up to five distinct stages, each with specific learning objectives:

#### Learn Stage
- **Purpose**: Introduction and exploration of new concepts
- **Content**: Interactive tutorials, explanations, and guided practice
- **Duration**: Typically 2-5 minutes
- **Scoring**: No formal scoring, focuses on understanding
- **Prerequisites**: None (entry point for new concepts)

#### Play Stage
- **Purpose**: Practice and reinforcement through interactive gameplay
- **Content**: Engaging activities that reinforce the concept
- **Duration**: 3-8 minutes depending on complexity
- **Scoring**: Practice scoring for motivation, not mastery
- **Prerequisites**: Completion of Learn stage

#### Quiz Stage
- **Purpose**: Assessment of understanding with clear mastery targets
- **Content**: Formal assessment of the concept
- **Duration**: 2-5 minutes
- **Scoring**: Mastery scoring with target thresholds
- **Prerequisites**: Completion of Play stage

#### Challenge Stage (Optional)
- **Purpose**: Advanced practice for motivated learners
- **Content**: More difficult variations of the concept
- **Duration**: 5-10 minutes
- **Scoring**: Advanced scoring with higher thresholds
- **Prerequisites**: Mastery of Quiz stage

#### Review Stage
- **Purpose**: Spaced repetition for long-term retention
- **Content**: Reintroduction of the concept after time delay
- **Duration**: 2-5 minutes
- **Scoring**: Separate scoring system for retention tracking
- **Prerequisites**: Completion of Quiz stage, scheduled based on forgetting curves

## Scoring System

### Target Scores
- **Learn Stage**: No target score (completion-based)
- **Play Stage**: Practice score for motivation (not mastery)
- **Quiz Stage**: Mastery target score (e.g., 80% for mastery)
- **Challenge Stage**: Advanced target score (e.g., 90% for excellence)
- **Review Stage**: Retention target score (e.g., 70% for retention)

### Score Persistence
- **Quiz Scores**: Primary mastery indicator, stored permanently
- **Review Scores**: Separate retention tracking, stored permanently
- **Play Scores**: Practice motivation, stored for recent sessions
- **Challenge Scores**: Advanced achievement, stored permanently

### Mastery Criteria
- **Mastery**: Achieving target score on Quiz stage
- **Excellence**: Achieving target score on Challenge stage
- **Retention**: Achieving target score on Review stage
- **Progression**: Mastery required to advance to next concept
