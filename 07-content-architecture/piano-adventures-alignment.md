## MLC Sequence Integration

### Sequence Code: FABR
The Piano Adventures alignment uses the sequence code `FABR` (Faber Piano Adventures) in the MLC system, following the established naming convention for method-aligned sequences.

### Method Alignment Metadata
Each Piano Adventures sequence includes standardized metadata for compatibility:

- **Publisher**: Faber and Faber
- **Series Name**: Piano Adventures
- **Book Levels**: Primer, 1, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4, 5
- **Edition Year**: Current edition (updated as new editions are released)
- **Page Correlation**: Unit number, page range, lesson title
- **Skill Mapping**: Concept tags, difficulty tier, prerequisite skills
- **Progression Markers**: Milestone assignments, assessment points

### Content Mapping Strategy

#### Game-to-Concept Alignment
Each Piano Adventures level maps to specific MLC games that teach corresponding concepts:

- **Keyboard Elements**: LetterFly series for note identification
- **Staff Reading**: Page Turner and Note Balloons series for staff recognition
- **Rhythm**: Rhythm Pop, Rhythm Rally, and Rhythm Writer series
- **Intervals**: Interval games (Catch the Coconut, Climbing High)
- **Scales**: Pentascale and scale identification games
- **Harmony**: Triad and chord progression games

#### Skill Progression Tracking
The alignment ensures that:
- Prerequisite skills are mastered before advancing
- Each level builds upon previous concepts
- Assessment points align with Piano Adventures milestones
- Review scheduling supports long-term retention

### Assignment Structure
Each Piano Adventures level is organized into assignments that mirror the book structure:

- **Unit-based Organization**: Assignments correspond to book units
- **Page-specific Correlations**: Individual games map to specific page ranges
- **Skill-focused Groupings**: Related concepts are grouped together
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each assignment builds upon previous learning

## Implementation Requirements

### Content Validation
