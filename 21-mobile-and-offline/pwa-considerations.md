# PWA Considerations

This document defines Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities, offline functionality strategies, and app-like behaviors for the MLC LMS platform to enable installation, offline access, and enhanced mobile experiences.

## Purpose

This specification establishes how the MLC LMS platform leverages Progressive Web App technologies to deliver app-like experiences across desktop and mobile devices without requiring native app store distribution. PWA capabilities enable:

- **Installability**: Users can add the platform to their home screen or desktop, creating an app-like shortcut
- **Offline Access**: Students can continue learning even when network connectivity is unreliable or unavailable
- **Fast Loading**: Pre-cached assets and app shell provide instant loading on repeat visits
- **Background Sync**: Actions taken offline are automatically synchronized when connectivity returns
- **Push Notifications**: Re-engagement through browser-based push notifications (where supported)
- **Platform Parity**: Consistent experience across iOS, Android, and desktop without maintaining separate native apps

The PWA approach is particularly valuable for educational contexts where students may have:
- Intermittent internet connectivity (rural areas, commutes, cellular data limits)
- Shared devices with limited storage for native apps
- Restricted ability to install apps from app stores (school-managed devices)
- Need to practice music skills without constant internet dependency

**Phase Timing**: PWA features are marked as **post-Phase 1** enhancements. The initial platform focuses on online-first experiences, with PWA capabilities added after core functionality is validated and stable.

## Scope

### Included

**PWA Core Capabilities**:
- Service Worker implementation strategy and lifecycle management
- Web App Manifest configuration for installability
- App shell architecture and caching strategies
- Offline functionality specifications (what works offline, what requires network)
- Install prompts and user onboarding for PWA features
- Update strategies for new versions of the PWA
- Platform-specific PWA behaviors (iOS Safari, Android Chrome, Desktop)

**Offline Functionality Design**:
- Offline-capable features (game practice, review of completed assignments)
- Network-required features (new assignment fetching, score submission, leaderboards)
- Offline queue management for deferred actions
- Background sync for submitting scores and progress when connectivity returns
- Conflict resolution when offline changes clash with server state
- User feedback for offline status and sync progress

**Installation and App Shell**:
- Home screen installation prompts and criteria
- App icons, splash screens, and branding for installed PWA
- App shell loading strategy for instant perceived performance
- Navigation structure for installed app experience
- Standalone vs. browser mode behaviors

**Enhanced Capabilities**:
- Push notification implementation (desktop and mobile)
- Badge API for unread counts on home screen icon
- Shortcuts API for quick actions from home screen
- Share Target API for receiving content from other apps (future consideration)

## Data Model

### PWA Installation State
```typescript
interface PWAInstallState {
  isInstallable: boolean; // Can be installed as PWA
  isInstalled: boolean; // Currently installed as PWA
  installPromptShown: boolean; // User has seen install prompt
  installPromptDismissed: boolean; // User dismissed prompt
  lastPromptTimestamp: Date | null;
  platform: 'ios' | 'android' | 'desktop' | 'unknown';
  displayMode: 'standalone' | 'browser' | 'minimal-ui' | 'fullscreen';
}
```

### Service Worker State
```typescript
interface ServiceWorkerState {
  isSupported: boolean; // Browser supports Service Workers
  isRegistered: boolean; // Service Worker is registered
  isActive: boolean; // Service Worker is active and controlling page
  version: string; // Current SW version (for update detection)
  updateAvailable: boolean; // New version available
  lastUpdateCheck: Date | null;
  cacheStatus: {
    appShellCached: boolean;
    gameAssetsCached: number; // Count of cached games
    totalCacheSize: number; // Bytes
  };
}
```

### Offline Queue
```typescript
interface OfflineQueueItem {
  id: string; // Unique queue item ID
  type: 'score_submission' | 'progress_update' | 'message_send' | 'assignment_complete';
  payload: any; // Action-specific data
  timestamp: Date; // When action was queued
  retryCount: number;
  maxRetries: number;
  status: 'queued' | 'syncing' | 'success' | 'failed';
  errorMessage?: string;
}

interface OfflineQueue {
  items: OfflineQueueItem[];
  isSyncing: boolean;
  lastSyncAttempt: Date | null;
  lastSuccessfulSync: Date | null;
}
```

### Offline-Enabled Content
```typescript
interface OfflineContent {
  gameId: string;
  gameMetadata: GameMetadata; // From Game Model
  assetsDownloaded: boolean;
  assetUrls: string[]; // List of cached asset URLs
  downloadedAt: Date;
  lastAccessedAt: Date;
  sizeBytes: number;
}

interface OfflineAssignment {
  assignmentId: string;
  studentId: string;
  games: OfflineContent[];
  assignmentMetadata: AssignmentMetadata;
  downloadedAt: Date;
  expiresAt: Date | null; // Optional expiration for offline access
}
```

## Behavior and Rules

### Service Worker Lifecycle

#### Registration and Installation
**On First Visit**:
1. Browser loads the application normally (no Service Worker yet)
2. After page load completes, Service Worker registration begins
3. Service Worker installs in background, pre-caching app shell
4. On next visit, Service Worker activates and takes control

**Update Detection**:
1. Service Worker checks for updates every 24 hours or on page navigation
2. If new version detected, downloads new Service Worker in background
3. New Service Worker enters "waiting" state until all tabs close
4. User sees "Update Available" notification with option to refresh
5. On user confirmation, old Service Worker replaced, page reloads with new version

**Version Management**:
```typescript
// Service Worker versioning pattern
const SW_VERSION = 'v1.2.3'; // Semantic versioning
const CACHE_NAME = `mlc-lms-${SW_VERSION}`;

// On activation, clear old caches
self.addEventListener('activate', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.keys().then((cacheNames) => {
      return Promise.all(
        cacheNames
          .filter((name) => name.startsWith('mlc-lms-') && name !== CACHE_NAME)
          .map((name) => caches.delete(name))
      );
    })
  );
});
```

### Offline Functionality Strategy

#### Offline-Capable Features
The following features are designed to work fully offline after initial download:

**Game Practice Mode**:
- Students can play previously accessed games offline
- Game assets (HTML, JS, CSS, images, audio) pre-cached
- Scores recorded locally, synced when online
- Progress tracked, submitted upon reconnection

**Assignment Review**:
- Students can review completed assignments offline
- View past scores, badges earned, and feedback
- Cannot start new assignments or fetch new content

**Profile and Settings**:
- View student profile information
- Adjust local settings (sound volume, preferences)
- Changes sync when connectivity returns

**Content Browsing (Limited)**:
- Browse cached game library
- View descriptions and metadata for cached games
- Cannot access uncached games or search for new content

#### Network-Required Features
The following features require active internet connectivity:

**New Assignment Fetching**:
- Retrieving newly assigned work from teachers
- Loading games not previously cached
- Real-time assignment generation

**Leaderboards and Social Features**:
- Live leaderboards require fresh data
- Challenge boards need real-time updates
- Teacher messaging requires network

**Account Changes**:
- Password changes, email updates
- Subscription and billing operations
- Administrative functions

**Real-Time Analytics**:
- Teacher dashboards showing live student progress
- System admin monitoring and alerts

### Offline Queue and Background Sync

**Queue Management**:
When offline, user actions are queued for later submission:
1. Action captured with timestamp and payload
2. Stored in IndexedDB for persistence
3. User sees "Saved locally, will sync when online" confirmation
4. Network connectivity monitored via `navigator.onLine` and periodic fetch attempts

**Background Sync Process**:
```typescript
// Register background sync for score submission
if ('sync' in self.registration) {
  await self.registration.sync.register('sync-offline-queue');
}

// Background sync handler in Service Worker
self.addEventListener('sync', (event) => {
  if (event.tag === 'sync-offline-queue') {
    event.waitUntil(syncOfflineQueue());
  }
});

async function syncOfflineQueue() {
  const queue = await getOfflineQueue(); // From IndexedDB
  for (const item of queue) {
    try {
      await submitToServer(item);
      await markItemSynced(item.id);
    } catch (error) {
      item.retryCount++;
      if (item.retryCount >= item.maxRetries) {
        await markItemFailed(item.id, error.message);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Conflict Resolution**:
When offline changes conflict with server state:
- **Score Submissions**: Accept highest score (offline or online)
- **Progress Updates**: Merge progress, never decrease completion
- **Profile Changes**: Server state wins, show user notification of override
- **Message Sends**: Both retained if both sent during offline period

### Installation Prompts and User Experience

#### Install Prompt Trigger Conditions
Display PWA install prompt when:
1. User is on a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari 16.4+)
2. Web App Manifest is valid and served
3. Service Worker successfully registered
4. User has visited site at least twice
5. At least 5 minutes have passed since first visit
6. User has not previously dismissed the prompt in last 30 days

**iOS Safari Specific**:
iOS requires manual installation via Share → Add to Home Screen. Show contextual guidance:
```
To install MLC on your iPhone:
1. Tap the Share button (□ with arrow)
2. Scroll and tap "Add to Home Screen"
3. Tap "Add" to confirm
```

**Android Chrome Specific**:
Chrome on Android shows native install prompt. Enhance with custom UI:
```typescript
let deferredPrompt;

window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Prevent automatic prompt
  deferredPrompt = e;
  showCustomInstallButton(); // Show our custom UI
});

async function installPWA() {
  if (deferredPrompt) {
    deferredPrompt.prompt();
    const { outcome } = await deferredPrompt.userChoice;
    if (outcome === 'accepted') {
      trackEvent('pwa_installed', { platform: 'android' });
    }
    deferredPrompt = null;
  }
}
```

**Desktop (Chrome/Edge) Specific**:
Desktop browsers show install icon in address bar. Provide prominent in-app install button:
- Location: Top-right corner of navigation bar
- Label: "Install App" with download icon
- Dismissable but reappears after 7 days

#### Post-Installation Experience
After installation:
1. App opens in standalone mode (no browser UI)
2. Welcome message: "Welcome to MLC! You can now use the app offline."
3. Prompt to download favorite games for offline access
4. Badge icon shows unread assignment count (if Badge API supported)

### Update Notification Strategy

**Update Available Notification**:
When new Service Worker version is waiting:
```
A new version of MLC is available!
[Update Now] [Later]
```

**Update Behavior**:
- **Update Now**: Skips waiting, activates new SW immediately, reloads page
- **Later**: User continues with old version, update applies on next full app close
- If user doesn't choose within 24 hours, auto-update on next session

**Force Update Scenarios**:
For critical security patches or breaking changes:
1. Server sends `X-Force-Update: true` header
2. Client detects header, shows blocking modal: "Critical update required"
3. User must update to continue (no "Later" option)

### Platform-Specific Behaviors

#### iOS Safari (14.5+, PWA support in 16.4+)
**Capabilities**:
- Home screen installation (manual only)
- Standalone mode (full-screen without Safari UI)
- Service Worker support (limited in iOS < 16.4)
- No push notifications (not supported for PWAs on iOS as of 2025)
- No background sync (iOS suspends PWAs aggressively)

**Limitations**:
- Storage quota limits (50MB typical, can be cleared by iOS)
- No Web App Manifest icon badging
- Service Worker may be terminated aggressively to save battery
- Audio context must be resumed on user gesture (see [Browser Compatibility Matrix](../18-architecture/browser-compatibility-matrix.md))

**Optimizations**:
- Use `apple-touch-icon` meta tags for high-quality home screen icons
- Minimize offline cache size to stay under quota
- Implement aggressive cache eviction for less-used content
- Provide clear feedback when iOS-unsupported features are unavailable

#### Android Chrome (90+)
**Capabilities**:
- Native install prompt (`beforeinstallprompt` event)
- Push notifications fully supported
- Background sync fully supported
- Web App Manifest with shortcuts
- App badge for notification counts
- Large offline storage quota (typically 60% of available storage)

**Optimizations**:
- Implement shortcuts for quick actions (e.g., "Continue Last Assignment")
- Use notification channels for different message types
- Leverage background sync for robust offline submission
- Cache more content aggressively given larger quota

#### Desktop (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari)
**Capabilities**:
- Install from browser address bar or custom prompt
- Push notifications (with user permission)
- Large offline storage (typically 50-60% of disk)
- Desktop shortcuts and taskbar integration
- Window management (separate window for installed app)

**Optimizations**:
- Desktop gets priority for download caching (larger quota)
- Use `display: standalone` for app-like window experience
- Keyboard shortcuts work in standalone mode (see [Responsive Behaviors](./responsive-behaviors.md#desktop-alternative-actions))
- Support drag-and-drop file uploads from desktop

## UX Requirements

### Offline Status Indicator

**Persistent Status Bar**:
- When offline, show dismissible banner at top of page
- Text: "You're offline. Some features are unavailable. [Dismiss]"
- Color: Amber/yellow background with dark text (not red to avoid alarm)
- Auto-dismisses when connectivity returns, shows brief "Back online" confirmation

**Feature-Level Feedback**:
When user attempts network-required action while offline:
```
Cannot Load New Assignment (Offline)
You need an internet connection to fetch new assignments.
[Try Again] [Continue Offline Practice]
```

### Download Management Interface

**Download Games for Offline**:
Provide interface for students/teachers to pre-download games:

**Location**: Settings → Offline Mode → Download Games

**UI**:
```
Download Games for Offline Practice
Storage Used: 45 MB of 200 MB available

Downloaded (5 games):
✓ Note Reading Challenge - 12 MB [Remove]
✓ Rhythm Flash Cards - 8 MB [Remove]
...

Available to Download:
○ Interval Trainer - 15 MB [Download]
○ Chord Explorer - 20 MB [Download]
...

[Download All Assigned Games (80 MB)]
```

**Behavior**:
- Show estimated download size before starting
- Display progress bar during download
- Allow cancellation mid-download
- Provide option to remove downloaded games to free space
- Auto-remove least-recently-used games if storage quota exceeded

### Install Prompt UI

**Custom Install Banner (Non-Intrusive)**:
- Position: Bottom of viewport (mobile) or top banner (desktop)
- Design: Card with app icon, brief description, and Install button
- Text: "Install MLC for faster access and offline practice"
- Action: [Install] [Not Now]
- Dismissal: Hides for 30 days if "Not Now" clicked

**Benefits Messaging**:
When user clicks "Install" button, show benefits before native prompt:
```
Install MLC App

✓ Faster loading on every visit
✓ Practice games offline
✓ Add to home screen for easy access
✓ Get notifications about new assignments

[Install Now] [Maybe Later]
```

### Update Notification UI

**Non-Blocking Update Banner**:
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔄 Update Available                        │
│ A new version of MLC is ready to install. │
│ [Update Now] [Later]                       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Blocking Update Modal (Critical Updates Only)**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                             │
│        Critical Update Required             │
│                                             │
│  A security update is required to          │
│  continue using MLC.                        │
│                                             │
│             [Update Now]                    │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Offline Queue Status UI

**Sync Status Indicator**:
When offline queue has pending items:
- Show badge on profile icon: "3 pending"
- In Settings → Offline Sync: List pending actions
- UI:
```
Offline Sync Queue (3 items pending)

○ Score submission: Note Reading Challenge (2 min ago)
○ Assignment completion: Rhythm Practice (10 min ago)
○ Message to teacher: "Need help with..." (1 hour ago)

[Sync Now] (available when online)
```

**Sync Success Notification**:
When items successfully sync:
```
✓ Synced 3 items successfully
Your offline work has been submitted.
```

**Sync Failure Notification**:
If sync fails after retries:
```
⚠️ Sync Failed
Some items couldn't be synced. Check your connection.
[View Details] [Retry]
```

## Open Questions

### Storage and Quota Management
- **Q**: What is the offline storage quota policy per user?
  - **Consideration**: Students may share devices, quotas should be per-device not per-user
  - **Current thinking**: 200 MB default quota, with option to request more for premium subscribers

- **Q**: How to handle quota exceeded scenarios gracefully?
  - **Options**: 
    1. Auto-evict least-recently-used content
    2. Prompt user to select games to remove
    3. Disable new downloads until space freed
  - **Recommendation**: Combination of 1 and 2 - auto-evict with user notification

- **Q**: Should teachers be able to pre-download content for their students?
  - **Use Case**: Teacher prepares class iPads with offline content before lesson
  - **Technical Challenge**: Cross-user content provisioning in shared device scenarios
  - **Status**: Deferred to post-Phase 1, requires research

### Platform-Specific Challenges

- **Q**: How to handle iOS Safari's aggressive Service Worker termination?
  - **Impact**: Background sync and push notifications don't work reliably on iOS
  - **Workaround**: Store offline queue in IndexedDB, sync on next app open
  - **User Messaging**: "On iOS, offline changes sync when you open the app"

- **Q**: Should we provide different offline experiences for mobile vs. desktop?
  - **Consideration**: Desktop has more storage quota and processing power
  - **Current thinking**: Same features, but desktop caches more games by default
  - **Decision needed**: Should desktop get exclusive features (e.g., download all games)?

### Feature Prioritization

- **Q**: Which features should be prioritized for offline support in Phase 2?
  - **Options**:
    1. Offline game playing (high value, moderate complexity)
    2. Offline assignment review (moderate value, low complexity)
    3. Offline messaging (low value, high complexity due to sync conflicts)
  - **Recommendation**: Start with #1 and #2, defer #3

- **Q**: Should we implement push notifications in Phase 2 or later?
  - **Value**: Re-engagement and timely assignment reminders
  - **Complexity**: Platform-specific implementations, permission management
  - **User Concern**: Notification fatigue, privacy concerns
  - **Recommendation**: Phase 3, after core offline functionality proven

### Update and Versioning

- **Q**: How frequently should Service Worker check for updates?
  - **Too frequent**: Unnecessary network requests, battery drain
  - **Too infrequent**: Users stuck on old versions with bugs
  - **Current thinking**: Every 24 hours, or on navigation after 24 hours since last check
  - **Open**: Should critical users (teachers, admins) get faster update checks?

- **Q**: How to handle breaking changes in offline-cached data structures?
  - **Scenario**: Assignment model changes, offline assignments no longer compatible
  - **Options**:
    1. Force-clear all offline data on breaking change
    2. Migrate offline data to new format
    3. Version offline data, reject incompatible versions
  - **Recommendation**: Use versioned offline storage, with migration utilities
