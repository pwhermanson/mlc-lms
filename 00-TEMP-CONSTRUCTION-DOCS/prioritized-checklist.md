Please perform this workflow exactly as written. Do not start enhancement work until Step 1 is completed and verified. If at anytime there is a file in 00-ORIG-CONTEXT that seems relevant, but you are not able to access, please mark the beginning of the line with this exact text: "NEED CONTEXT" + [filename] and pause the workflow.

Step 1 — Select and mark In Progress
Find the first item in 00-TEMP-CONSTRUCTION-DOCS/prioritized-checklist.md that:
is not prefixed with ✅ and
does not already contain - In Progress. If there is already an item in progress, then it is being worked on by somebody else. You need to then select the next item that isn't already marked as in-progress.
Immediately update that line to append the exact text - "In Progress" (space-hyphen-space case-sensitive) at the beginning of the line.
Save the file and re-open it to verify the change is present.
If no eligible item exists, stop and report that the checklist is fully completed or all remaining items are already In Progress.
Step 2 — Understand context
Open 00-ORIG-CONTEXT/ and review only materials relevant to the chosen item’s topic.
Identify the focused value of the page you’re enhancing (what it uniquely provides vs. other docs).
Step 3 — Enhance the chosen page (additive only)
Add information that advances the page’s specific goal; do not duplicate content that lives elsewhere.
When related details exist in other docs, reference them briefly and link internally rather than re-stating.
Keep edits purely additive; do not remove or rewrite existing content unless fixing typos/structure for clarity.
Preserve existing indentation and style.
Step 4 — Cross-check for redundancy
Confirm that added content is not already present in another page and won’t be covered more deeply elsewhere.
If overlap is useful, reference at a high level and link to the canonical doc.
Step 5 — Telemetry and dependencies (if applicable)
If the page mentions events, data, or roles, reference existing specs (e.g., event model, permissions, UX standards) instead of duplicating them.
Step 6 — Finalize and check off
When the enhancement is complete and saved, return to 00-TEMP-CONSTRUCTION-DOCS/prioritized-checklist.md.
Replace the - In Progress suffix on the chosen item with a leading ✅ to mark it complete (do not leave - In Progress).
Save and verify the checklist now shows the item as completed.
Rules and safeguards
Only one item is - In Progress at a time.
If you must switch items mid-way, first revert the previous item by removing - In Progress (unless it is now complete), then mark the new item - In Progress.
Never check off an item until edits to its target page are complete and saved.
Do not alter any other checklist lines except the current item being processed.
Exact formatting
In-progress format: [path/to/doc.md](../path/to/doc.md) - In Progress
Completed format: ✅ [path/to/doc.md](../path/to/doc.md)
Verification steps (must do)
After Step 1 and Step 6, re-open the checklist file and confirm the exact expected text is present.
If verification fails, fix the formatting immediately before proceeding.
Optional status notes
At the start of your run, post a short note: “Marked X as In Progress.”
At the end: “Completed X and checked it off.”
This prompt ensures the in-progress status is marked first, verified, and later replaced by a checkmark only after the enhancement is complete.
