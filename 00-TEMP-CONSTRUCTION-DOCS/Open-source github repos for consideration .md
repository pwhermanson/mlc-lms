Open-Source Components for MLC LMS Platform
============================================

Building a modern, browser-based LMS for music education requires integrating multiple open-source tools. This document presents a curated selection of permissively licensed repositories that fit the needs of MusicLearningCommunity.com's new platform, organized by fit assessment and implementation priority.

**All selected projects use MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, MPL-2.0, or CC0 licenses (no GPL/AGPL/SSPL).**

## EXCELLENT FITS ⭐⭐⭐
*Essential components that directly address core MLC LMS requirements*


### 1. XState – Workflow & State Machine Orchestration (MIT) ⭐⭐⭐
**Perfect fit for your staged game system!**
- **Why it's ideal**: Your Learn→Play→Quiz→Challenge→Review game stages are exactly what state machines excel at
- **Specific use cases**: 
  - Enforce progression rules (can't access Quiz until Learn is complete)
  - Handle "review gating" flows (Review stages scheduled based on mastery)
  - Manage assignment sequences and prerequisites
- **Implementation**: Define each game stage as states, transitions based on scores, perfect for your mastery-first approach
- **Stats**: 6.8k commits, ~20k npm weekly downloads, well-maintained and framework-agnostic
#### Our Human Review - Functionality is needed. Will review if this repo is the right way to address this need.  One of the problems with the current system is that students will get stuck and it doesn't allow them to progress to the next level. Perhaps with this plug-in, XState, it has a fail-safe built into it that allows for kids to be moved forward if they get stuck.


### 2. VexFlow – Music Notation Rendering Library (MIT) ⭐⭐⭐
**Essential for music education platform!**
- **Why it's perfect**: You need to display music scores, chord charts, and notation-based quiz questions

  - Render chord progressions and scales
  - Create interactive notation exercises
- **Integration**: Works perfectly with your React/Next.js stack
- **Stats**: Used in many music apps, publication-quality output
#### Our Human Review - Might help us make new games. Is there a limit to the size of the notes? Is big a gamey? or is it too professional and tiny? This could be helpful for information displayed prior to the game to display how it works, or perhaps someday when we create the "Composer's Corner." If we come across again where there is an image that needs to be recreated, maybe this could be used.

### 3. Tone.js – Web Audio/MIDI Framework (MIT) ⭐⭐⭐
